<p class="noi title">THE CRIMSON BANNER</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>A SINGULAR LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One pleasant evening during the first week in
April I left my room in Colver Hall, and started
across the campus of Belmont College toward the
main street of the town. As I approached the gateway
at the entrance to the grounds, I noticed several of
the boys sitting upon and around the two large cannons
that stood on either side of the gateway, mounted
upon their old fashioned iron carriages.</p>

<p>These old cannons were landmarks of the college,
and dear to the heart of every inmate. Many years
before they had been discovered by a rambling party
of students in a deserted part of the hilly country
about ten miles west of Belmont. It was believed that
they had been left there by a section of the army during
the war of 1812. However that might be, they
were appropriated and dragged home to the college,
where they were enthusiastically adopted by the students,
and soon became favorite lounging posts. Almost
every warm afternoon or evening would find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
several fellows perched on the old artillery or seated
near by, reading, chatting, or singing college songs.</p>

<p>Through the deepening twilight I recognized two of
my classmates leaning against one of the cannon.</p>

<p>“Hello, Miller,” I called out, “where is Tony
Larcom?”</p>

<p>“Down by the lake, I think,” was the answer. “He
was here about twenty minutes ago, and said he was
going to the boat house to look after his canoe.”</p>

<p>Retracing my steps, I hurried around old Burke
Hall, the main building of the college, and crossed the
back quadrangle. Then, leaving the circuitous path
to the boat house, I struck out on a straight line down
through the underbrush toward the shore of the lake.
There I stood a moment, close to the dock, looking
out over the water.</p>

<p>The dusk prevented my seeing further than fifty
yards ahead, and in that space no sign of Tony’s boat
appeared, so, putting my hands to my mouth, I
called out at the top of my voice,</p>

<p>“Hello, Tony Larcom!”</p>

<p>The cry rang out over the quiet sheet of water,
and echoed back from the rugged sides of Mount
Bell, which loomed up in the evening sky beyond the
lake.</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, I repeated my call several times
with increasing force.</p>

<p>Suddenly a queer chuckling noise sounded almost
immediately beside me, and peering through the bushes,
I saw the face of Tony Larcom not four feet in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of me. He was seated quietly in his canoe, and with
difficulty repressing his laughter.</p>

<p>“Did you speak?” he asked, straightening his face
into an expression of gravity, when he found he had
been discovered.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I answered sarcastically. “I was only
breathing hard. What do you mean by sitting there
without a word while I was shouting myself hoarse?”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t recognize you at first, Harry. You
had your mouth open so wide I couldn’t see you at
all. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Do you realize the fact that there is to be a mass
meeting of the college in the Latin room at half past
seven to consider baseball matters, and that you, as
secretary of the association, must be there?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing down here by the lake?
I’ve been looking all over for you, and was afraid you
were going to play us your old trick of forgetting all
about an important engagement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not this time. I wouldn’t miss the mass
meeting for the world. There was plenty of time, and
I wanted to see how my canoe had stood the winter,
so I came down to try her on the water. She will
be all right with a little paint. Give me a hand here
and help me get her out.”</p>

<p>Tony paddled along toward the boat house, while
I accompanied him, pushing my way through the
bushes that grew thickly by the water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>When we had reached the dock I helped him drag
out the canoe and carry it into the boat house.</p>

<p>As he made it fast to the wall, Tony remarked,</p>

<p>“There will be something besides baseball to interest
the boys tonight. I have a letter to read.”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>“From Park College.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“Read it and see,” said Tony, taking a letter from
his pocket and handing it to me.</p>

<p>I opened it, and, standing in the light of the single
oil lamp fastened against the wall, I read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi"><i>To the Students of Belmont College</i>:</p>

<p>On a number of occasions during late years your attention
has been called to the claims of Park College to the cannons
which stand upon your campus. Enough evidence has been
produced to convince an unprejudiced mind of our right of
ownership of said cannons, but this evidence has in every
case been rejected by you. We, the students of Park College,
have at length decided to take a positive stand in the matter,
and, accordingly, submit to you this formal demand for the
surrender of the cannons to us. Should this be disregarded,
we shall take more active steps to secure our rights. We
trust this will secure your immediate attention, and await the
favor of your reply.</p>
</div>

<p>I looked up in amazement. Tony winked.</p>

<p>“How is that for a game of bluff?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What in the world do they mean by ‘active
steps’?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Legal proceedings would be simply
absurd. My idea is that they think because their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
college is a trifle larger than ours that they can bully
us. They have always wanted the cannons, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I thought they had given up all claims
several years ago when the subject was thoroughly
discussed in the college papers. You remember, they
claimed that the cannons were in their country, two
miles from Berkeley, and so belonged to them. But
it was decided then that they belonged to nobody, and
as our students had found them, they were ours by
right of treasure trove as well as forty years’ possession.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you know how it is in college: a new
batch of students comes in and revives old sores. Now
they are at it again, and now it is <em>our</em> business to
meet them as it was our predecessor’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will, and with a vengeance, too, if necessary.
Did you show the letter to Edwards?”</p>

<p>Edwards was the managing editor of the college
paper, the <cite>Belmont Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p>“No; I received it only two hours ago in the late
afternoon mail. Come up to Burke Hall, and we will
have some fun with it. Watch the sensation when I
read it to the boys in the mass meeting.”</p>

<p>Closing the side door of the boat house, Tony padlocked
it, and we started back again toward the campus.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Ray Wendell this afternoon?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No; but of course he will be on hand. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
would a baseball meeting be without Ray Wendell?
By the way, what a scare he gave me last month when
he hinted about resigning the captaincy.”</p>

<p>“That was a queer notion. What started it, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“He said he was afraid it would interfere with his
studies, especially his preparation for his final examinations.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“Well, you know he is working for one of the
honorary orations at commencement, and he said he
would have to work hard, for there is to be a good
deal of competition this year.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Wendell is sure of an oration, and
probably the valedictory. There isn’t a smarter man
in the Senior class. There is no reason why baseball
should interfere at all.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. If we are to have a winning team
this year it will only be with Ray Wendell as captain—and
so I told him. I showed him that all the
fellows looked to him, and the college reputation
rested in his hands. That soon brought him to terms,
and he has never mentioned the matter since. I can’t
help thinking, however, that there was more back of
that freak of his than he said.”</p>

<p>“He knows as well as the rest of us how necessary
he is to the nine,” I rejoined.</p>

<p>“And for that very reason I think something must
have influenced him. At first I thought perhaps his
father had asked him to give up baseball, but then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
I remembered that Mr. Wendell always seemed to be
as proud of Ray’s athletics as he was of his high
rank in his class. Still, I don’t care, now that he has
let the matter drop.”</p>

<p>“What is that crowd doing outside of Burke Hall?”
I asked. “Do you suppose that old Ferguson has
forgotten to unlock the Latin room door?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it,” said Tony. “Still he must be
there, for the windows are bright. He must be lighting
up now.”</p>

<p>The question was promptly settled, for, while we
were speaking there was a sudden outburst of cheers,
and the crowd surged into the building. The doors
had evidently just been opened.</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned within as we entered. The
room was crowded to suffocation with a noisy, jostling
mass of students. Every seat was full, and many of
the boys were standing along the side walls. The
din was almost deafening. Suddenly Tony Larcom’s
presence was detected and immediately his name was
on every one’s lips.</p>

<p>“There’s Tony. Take the chair, Tony. Pass him
up to the platform, fellows.”</p>

<p>He was seized unceremoniously by a dozen pairs of
hands, and half dragged, half carried, to the desk.
There he stood a moment, laughing and kicking, until
he was released, when he sobered down, took out his
note book, and seated himself at a small desk in front
of the platform, ready for business.</p>

<p>I made my way to the front row where Dick Palmer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
had reserved a place for me with considerable difficulty,
by sitting in one seat and putting his feet in
the next one.</p>

<p>At this moment Clinton Edwards, who had been
asked by Tony to open the meeting, went upon the
platform and summoned the crowd to order by hammering
on the desk with a heavy ruler.</p>

<p>As all were intensely interested in the subject for
which the meeting was called, the room soon became
perfectly still.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>

</div>


<p>“Gentlemen,” began Clinton Edwards, “as you
are all aware, this meeting has been called for the
purpose of considering baseball matters. At the close
of last year’s season the nine held its customary annual
meeting, and the usual elections of secretary and
captain were made for the ensuing year. It now remains
with you to approve and ratify these elections,
and, in that event, the captain, as has been our custom
heretofore, becomes also president of the association.
The names of these officers were announced in the
<cite>Chronicle</cite> at the time of their election, as you doubtless
remember, but I will repeat them. Mr. Larcom
was elected secretary——”</p>

<p>The speaker paused a moment, when some one in
the back of the room called out, “I forbid the banns!”</p>

<p>The meeting was in an uproar at this. Laughter,
stamping of feet, and shouts of “Bully boy!” “Hi, hi
for Tony!” threatened to destroy the secretary’s gravity.
Rising, note book in hand, he said,</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of information.
Do I enter these remarks in the minutes?”</p>

<p>Edwards, ignoring the point, continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“The captaincy, which was made vacant by the
graduation of Mr. Terry, was filled by the election of
Mr. Wendell.”</p>

<p>There was now a long and uproarious burst of applause.
Cheer followed cheer as the name was announced.</p>

<p>A more popular man than Ray Wendell rarely
passed through Belmont College. Bright and industrious
in his studies, active and strong in athletics,
generous, good humored, and with agreeable and fascinating
manners Ray had been my ideal of a college
man since Freshman year.</p>

<p>As he rose modestly from his seat in answer to the
repeated cheers, I thought I had never seen him look
handsomer. His tall, graceful figure and fine face
never appeared to better advantage than at that moment
as he blushingly acknowledged the applause that
greeted his name.</p>

<p>Several times he attempted to speak, but the continued
cheering discouraged his effort. At length silence
was obtained, when Ray said smilingly, and
quickly turning attention from himself:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you forget that you have not yet decided
to be represented in the Berkshire League. You
have first to vote on the question: do we send out a
nine?”</p>

<p>“We scarcely need put that question,” said a student,
as Ray sat down. “It has been only a form in
past years, and I move, therefore, Mr. Chairman, that
we approve these elections——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“One moment, Mr. Chairman,” broke in a voice
from the back of the room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pratt has the floor,” said Edwards.</p>

<p>“I have finished,” said Pratt. “My motion is before
the meeting.”</p>

<p>It was seconded at once by a dozen voices. Then
the speaker at the back of the room rose slowly. It
was Len Howard, a Senior, and a prominent lawn
tennis player. He looked and acted as if he had a
hard and ugly task before him.</p>

<p>“Have I the floor now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You have,” answered Edwards.</p>

<p>“Then before putting this question I beg to say a
few words,” and Howard settled himself more firmly
on his feet, while most of us looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“I am a warm admirer of baseball, as warm an
admirer as there is in college. But I am also a warm
admirer of tennis, and it is in behalf of this latter
game that I want to speak. I beg to call attention
to the respective records of Belmont College in these
two sports. Year before last our baseball team
amounted to little—stood third in the League, last
year we were again third, and this year we have but
three players of the old nine left us, and prospects of
a still poorer record. Lawn tennis, on the other hand,
without any encouragement from the college, has
grown steadily in popularity and success, and today
it can send crack players to the intercollegiate tournaments
which take place in May. Its prospects are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
bright, and it deserves the college support. Now, Mr.
Chairman and gentlemen, should we not cultivate the
sport in which we stand the best show of success?
Last year the assistance of the college was promised
to tennis, but the funds were appropriated by the ball
team, or at least the ball team used up all the money
the college could contribute, and with the poor results
just mentioned. As the college apparently will not
extend its support to both, and it comes to a choice between
tennis and baseball, I think we ought to give
tennis the show it deserves for one year at least. I
think we ought to support tennis with our funds, and
not join the Berkshire Baseball League this year.”</p>

<p>Ray Wendell sprang up, his face flushed and his
eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, if this represents the sentiments
of the college toward baseball—if this echoes the
feelings of even one tenth of the students, I resign
from the nine immediately.”</p>

<p>There was a hush of several seconds’ duration, during
which the rest of us sat confounded with amazement
at the audacity of Howard. Suddenly the silence
was broken.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Tony Larcom, and his
chair toppled over backward, precipitating him with a
crash upon the floor.</p>

<p>Then arose an uproar on all sides. Fully three
dozen fellows were shouting and gesticulating wildly
to attract the attention and recognition of the chairman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Tony, unmindful of his ridiculous position, and intent
upon being heard, scrambled to his knees, and,
waving his arms beseechingly at the chairman, roared
out at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, have I the floor? Let me have
the floor—Mr. Chairman, please let me have the
floor for just five minutes.”</p>

<p>Dick Palmer reached forward as well as he could
for laughter, and touching Tony said,</p>

<p>“I should think you had got enough of the floor,
Tony. You’ve just had a whole back full of it.”</p>

<p>Tony, however, did not hear him, but continued his
appeals to the chairman. At length Edwards, who had
been standing puzzled in the midst of the confusion,
caught Tony’s eye, and brought down his ruler with
a bang.</p>

<p>“Mr. Larcom has the floor,” he called out. The
rest subsided with some difficulty, and Tony was left
master of the field for a time.</p>

<p>He rose hastily and brushed off his clothes. Then,
buttoning up his coat, he planted himself in front of
his desk and launched out.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: the words we have
just heard are a disgrace to any son of Belmont College.
What does Mr. Howard mean by calling baseball
to account? Have we a record to be ashamed
of? True, we have been unfortunate in the last two
years—every college has its bad spells—but why
doesn’t Mr. Howard go back further? Doesn’t the
gentleman remember that Belmont was the first college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to win the Crimson Banner when it was made the
trophy of the Berkshire League twelve years ago?
Doesn’t he remember that Belmont held that banner
for five consecutive years, lost it for three years, and
then won it for two years more—that the name of the
Belmont team has, therefore, seven times out of twelve
been inscribed upon that banner in letters of gold?
(Cheers.) And why did we lose last year? Not because
we had a poor nine, but because it was not well
handled. Every honest minded man in this room
knows that we would have won the banner had we
been headed by the efficient captain who leads us now.
(Cheers.) And yet this gentleman wishes us to relinquish
the game for a year. Does he realize that
we thereby lay ourselves open to being refused admission
to the League when we want to get back, and
that Park College for one would be only too glad
to get a chance to shut us out? Relinquish our nine?
Never! I would rather lose my right hand than our
nine. The speech we have just listened to is an insult
to every patriotic man in college, and a double insult
to the members of our old nine, and the able captain
whose election we are here to ratify.”</p>

<p>Immediately at the close of Tony’s speech, and while
the applause was still sounding, Dick Palmer rose and
tried to gain a hearing, but I caught him by the coat.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” I whispered. “Don’t you see Elton
is on the floor? He will use Howard up in two minutes.”</p>

<p>My hint was quickly taken by Dick, for Elton was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
one of the clearest thinkers in college, and had an established
reputation as a speaker. He commanded
universal respect in mass meetings, and consequently
there was an expectant hush as he began to speak.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, under some circumstances such a
speech as Mr. Howard’s might pass unnoticed. It
certainly can have no weight with us now, nor in any
way affect the motion. But it affords an opportunity
of saying a few words concerning the relative positions
of baseball and lawn tennis in the college.</p>

<p>“There is no college tennis association like our baseball
association. The baseball grounds and appurtenances
belong to us, have been purchased by money
contributed by us, and are conducted by officers elected
by us. It is a child of the college—the pet child—and
its record in the past shows how well it has repaid
our interest in it. Tennis, on the other hand, is of
individual interest in the college, and the tennis courts
here are the private property of the clubs that play
upon them. Some of these clubs exclude all from
playing on their courts except their own members. I
don’t criticise this. The courts are private property,
but for this very reason the college cannot be expected
to support tennis. What Mr. Howard says about the
funds last year is not true. The truth is that the question
was raised about a college appropriation of money
to tennis, and most of the tennis clubs <em>rejected the
idea</em>, preferring to pay their own expenses and run
their own courts. Only one or two clubs wanted college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
assistance and support, and Mr. Howard <em>is a
member of one of these clubs</em>.</p>

<p>“Again when our ball nine is successful, the Crimson
Banner, the trophy of victory, comes to the college,
and every student feels a share of the glory.
Victory in tennis is of individual interest, and appeals
chiefly to individual vanity. It means a silver
cup for a man, or perhaps two men. The college
gains little glory by it except in the most individual
way. Now, it is well known that the gentleman who
made this speech, is a strong tennis player. If then
he wishes the college at large to back him in competing
for a prize in the coming tournament, instead of his
own club, as has been the custom in the past, well
and good. We can consider the matter, though it
would not be in order at a baseball meeting. But if he
proposes that we shall relinquish our ball nine in order
to devote our money to the purpose of assisting him
to secure a prize cup, then I feel compelled to say
that I for one can find a better way of spending my
cash.”</p>

<p>As Elton finished, Howard made several movements
as if he would rise to speak, but several of his companions
were urging him to keep still, and at length,
influenced by their advice, he sank back and remained
quiet.</p>

<p>Then rose on all sides the cry of “Question! Question!”</p>

<p>Edwards responded:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, the question is called for, and will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
put. All in favor of Mr. Pratt’s motion that will approve
and ratify these elections say aye.”</p>

<p>There was a loud roar of assent.</p>

<p>“All opposed, by the contrary sign.”</p>

<p>There was no sound. Howard sat sullen and silent,
gazing at the floor.</p>

<p>“The motion is carried, and Mr. Wendell is therefore
elected president of the Association.”</p>

<p>Edwards laid down the ruler, and surrendering the
chair, descended from the platform.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>THE NEW PRESIDENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ray Wendell received an ovation as he took the
chair. Prolonged cheering greeted him, accompanied
by cries of “Speech! Speech!” When the noise had
subsided, Ray began:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I have no speech, nor, unless I am
much mistaken, do you want one. I thank you most
sincerely for your kindness, and promise you in behalf
of the nine that we will strive very hard to deserve
your interest. This is speech enough, I am sure.</p>

<p>“Of course you want to know what I think of our
prospects in baseball this year, and accordingly I say
here to-night what I have said to many of you personally—that
I consider our chances very good. It is
true that we have only three of our old nine left, but
the material which we have to choose from in the class
nines is good this year, and we ought to have a fine
team.</p>

<p>“Now as to the condition of the treasury—I have
been informed by the secretary that the funds of the
Association are almost exhausted. Will Mr. Larcom
report on this? What is the exact balance in the
treasury?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Tony turned over the pages of his note book and
figured busily for several seconds.</p>

<p>“There is a cash balance of $39.50,” he finally
called out.</p>

<p>“You can see from this,” continued Ray, “that the
usual contribution list will have to be started. You
will all hear later from Mr. Larcom concerning this,
and I hope we can look for as generous support as in
previous years, for the nine needs an almost complete
new outfit, and a number of repairs will have to be
made at the ball grounds, to say nothing of the pay
of the janitor and assistants at the club house, and
the expenses of our baseball tour.”</p>

<p>At this moment Alfred Carter, the leader of the
College Glee Club, took the floor and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I want to offer the services of the
Glee Club for the benefit of the team. I have made
arrangements to give a concert just before the Easter
vacation—that is, in about ten days, the proceeds of
which are to go to the baseball association. The concert
will be given in the large examination hall up
stairs, and,” he added, with a smile, “all members of
the college are cordially invited to attend—price 50
cents per head.”</p>

<p>Carter sat down amidst a great stamping and clapping
of hands.</p>

<p>Ray answered immediately:</p>

<p>“This is a most unexpected favor, Mr. Carter, and
I thank you sincerely in behalf of the Association for
this benefit, which, I am sure, will go a great way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
towards supplying the deficiency in our treasury. Is
there any further business before the meeting?”</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” asked Elton, “when does the convention
meet this year?”</p>

<p>“I am forced to say that I do not know as yet. For
some reason no word has reached me from the secretary
of the League, Mr. Slade of Halford College,
although it is much later than the usual date for
sending such notifications. Has Mr. Larcom received
any word today?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Tony.</p>

<p>“I shall probably hear tomorrow, and it is more
than likely that the convention will be held on some day
in the early part of next week. As soon as definite
notice reaches us, your representative will go on to
Berkeley, and a full account of the business of that
meeting will be reported in the <cite>Chronicle</cite>. This is as
complete information as I am able to give on the subject
this evening. Is there any other business? If
not, the——”</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” interrupted Tony, “may I have
one moment? I have no baseball business to bring
before the meeting, but I have received today a letter
which is addressed to the ‘students of Belmont College,’
so I presume that this is the time and place to
read it. Am I in order?”</p>

<p>Ray nodded.</p>

<p>“It is from Park College,” added Tony, taking from
his pocket the letter which I had read down at the boat
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>I watched the faces about me with interest, and I
shall never forget the rapid changes of expression that
passed over them—first curiosity, then eager attention,
astonishment, anger, and finally scornful amusement,
as the challenging letter was finished.</p>

<p>When Tony sat down, there was a chorus of howls,
accompanied by various exclamations such as “What
cheek! Want our cannons, do they? What are they
going to do about it? Tell them to come and get
them! Maybe they’d better ask for the whole town!——”</p>

<p>Ray hammered on the desk.</p>

<p>“You have heard the letter, gentlemen. What shall
we do with it?”</p>

<p>A sharp discussion followed. Some were in favor
of answering it with a heated reply, challenging Park
College to do their worst, whatever that might be, but
the majority were of the conviction that any notice
of the letter at all would be unwise.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” exclaimed one of the latter, “I
move we lay it on the table—<em>permanently</em>.”</p>

<p>“I have an amendment to offer,” said Elton. “I
move we lay it under the table. There is a waste
basket there.”</p>

<p>“These motions are out of order. They have not
been seconded,” said Ray.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t make any motion,” said Elton, rising
again. “I merely suggest that the best way to treat
such a letter as this is to ignore it utterly.”</p>

<p>All were coming around to this view of the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
so that when Ray asked again, “Gentlemen, what action
shall we take in reference to this letter?” no one
spoke.</p>

<p>Ray looked about for several seconds. “There being
no motion, the matter is dropped,” he said. “If
there is no further business the meeting is adjourned.”</p>

<p>Immediately there was a roar of mingled conversation,
whistling, and shuffling of feet as the meeting
broke up, and the crowd pressed out through the
large double doors.</p>

<p>When the room was nearly empty, and just as I was
passing out, Ray Wendell, who was still standing at
the platform, and talking with Tony Larcom, called
out,</p>

<p>“Hullo, Elder, wait a minute.”</p>

<p>I turned around, and, as I walked back, Ray said,</p>

<p>“We were just speaking about you, Harry. You
know each college sends three delegates to the convention—the
president and secretary of the Association,
and a member of the nine. I have selected you to go
with Tony Larcom and myself. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Only too glad,” I answered; “but how about Dick
Palmer? I don’t want to crowd him out if he wants
to go. You know, he has been a member of the nine
as long as I have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is all right. You have the advantage because
you were a regular member of the nine from
the start, while Dick was only substitute year before
last. I have spoken to him, and he acknowledges that
you have the choice by all odds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” I said, “I can go next week.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet for sure when it will be, as I
said in the meeting. It is curious I haven’t received a
word. I ought to have heard long ago. If I don’t
get a letter tomorrow morning I will telegraph to
Slade.”</p>

<p>“Well, a few hours’ warning is enough for me,”
I answered. “Good meeting tonight, wasn’t it? Lots
of excitement and enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tony, “and what puzzled me more than
anything else was Len Howard. No wonder I fell
flat. I was simply paralyzed. He must have been
crazy to make such a proposition.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said I, looking at Ray, “he was trying
to work off a grudge he has had against you ever
since you went out one Saturday afternoon last month
and beat him in tennis on his own court.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think there was anything personal
in it. I don’t think Howard nurses any grudge against
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t bank on that, Ray,” said Tony. “I
happen to know that he had a lot of money upon that
tennis game, and it ground him terribly to be beaten.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” rejoined Ray, raising his eyebrows
in surprise. “I never suspected there was anything
back of it when he asked me to play with him that
afternoon. Now, I remember he did seem to take his
defeat pretty badly. Still, it was his business. I had
nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Howard is very conceited about his tennis playing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
so you injured him at his most sensitive point.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry and yet, I don’t believe he bears
a grudge against me.”</p>

<p>“He may have more reason now, after his humiliation
this evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, let him, then,” said Ray. “He brought it
on himself. If he was foolish enough to bet, he must
suffer the consequences, and if he <em>will</em> make foolish
speeches, as he did tonight, he must stand the result
of that, too. He can’t blame me. I haven’t time to
bother with him—which reminds me that I have to
prepare for a recitation in astronomy tomorrow, and I
must get about it at once or I won’t be in bed before
midnight.”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch as we walked out of the
room.</p>

<p>“Phew!” he exclaimed. “It is half past nine—I’m
off—you will hear from me later—good night.”</p>

<p>And Ray walked hastily away toward Warburton
Hall, the handsome new dormitory in which his apartments
were located.</p>

<p>As I parted company from Tony Larcom, my first
intention was to go immediately to my room, but the
air being balmy and inviting, I walked leisurely down
the wide pathway toward the gate. Once there, I
seated myself by one of the old cannons, and gave
myself up to the pleasant influences of the quiet night.</p>

<p>I was thinking over the incidents of the meeting, its
interesting results, and how they would affect our
baseball prospects. Then I fell to contrasting the noise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and excitement of an hour before with the silence
that now reigned over the peaceful campus. A sense
of drowsiness came over me as I pursued these contemplations,
a drowsiness that gradually increased
until my head sank down, and at last, stretching myself
out at full length, I fell asleep.</p>

<p>How long I lay so I do not know, but I was suddenly
aroused by the sound of low voices close beside
me. I lay still indifferently, thinking that it must be
a couple of students enjoying the night air like myself.
The low whisper and the general tinge of mystery
with which they moved about, however, aroused
my suspicions. Thinking some mischief was brewing,
and that it would be fun to startle them, I roused up
and exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Hello! who’s there?”</p>

<p>The results far surpassed my expectations. There
was a quick exclamation of alarm, a sharp scuffling of
feet, a black shadow shot past me, and then I felt a
terrible, crushing blow on the side of my head, which
rolled me over and over into the pathway, where I lay
stunned and bewildered.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>LEN HOWARD AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For several moments I lay still, struggling to collect
my thoughts. Then, pressing my hand to my
head to relieve the numb, sickening sensation produced
by the blow, I sat up and stared about me in the
darkness.</p>

<p>The next instant a dark figure not ten feet before
me scrambled up from the grass and dashed out of the
gate. I was too much shaken up to think of pursuit,
so I sat still, listening attentively to the rapidly receding
footsteps.</p>

<p>From the sound of these I felt confident that there
were but two persons; and they were certainly badly
frightened, for they lost no time in covering ground,
and were in a few seconds far down the road, out of
earshot.</p>

<p>“Now what on earth could those fellows have been
up to?” I wondered, as I sat silently awaiting developments.</p>

<p>As nothing further occurred, I concluded that the
mischief must have been summarily postponed on account
of my appearance.</p>

<p>Whoever the mischief makers were, and whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
their plans may have been, they could not have regretted
my presence on the scene more than I did myself.
My head was aching and throbbing, while the
stinging sensation at the one side of my forehead, and
a little stream of blood, which I could feel trickling
down my cheek, showed me how severe the blow had
been.</p>

<p>As I rose to my feet I groped about in the dark
until I found my hat, which had rolled several feet
away from me; and then, brushing off the dust, I
stepped over to the spot where I had been sleeping,
and examined the grass carefully to see if the mysterious
visitors had left any traces behind them.</p>

<p>No results rewarded my search; so, as I was more
interested in my own condition than in their plans, I
decided to let the matter drop.</p>

<p>“We are quits,” I said to myself, as I walked away
toward Colver Hall. “I gave you a bad scare, and
you gave me a bad scar, though, after all, I think you
have the best of the bargain. One thing is certain:
the next time I fall in with any fellows bent on mischief,
I’ll leave them to the tender mercies of proctor
Murray. The rôle of night watchman doesn’t suit me
at all.”</p>

<p>On reaching my room I lit the gas, and examined
my face in the mirror which stood over the mantelpiece.
The skin had been broken, but the cut was not
deep, nor the wound so bad by any means as it might
have been, considering the force of the blow. On
washing away the blood, I found my forehead somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
swollen and purple, but in other respects fairly
presentable, so I felt there was cause for congratulating
myself on escaping so luckily.</p>

<p>It seemed quite evident to me that the injury I had
sustained had been purely accidental. It was more
than probable that the two students, whoever they
were, had been planning some escapade, and, when I
suddenly rose and interrupted them, they had become
startled, and had dashed off without waiting to learn
who it was. Not seeing me in the dark, the last of
the two had run straight over me, kicking me in the
head. The appearance of the wound, the manner in
which I had received the blow, and the effect it had
in tripping up the runner and sprawling him out on
the grass—all confirmed me in this solution of the
matter.</p>

<p>“It will probably be explained to-morrow,” I
thought; “for when I am seen at morning prayers
with a black and blue forehead, the fellow who kicked
me will no doubt recognize the mark and let me into
the secret. I suppose they were Freshmen, and up to
some of their tricks.”</p>

<p>I slept soundly all night in spite of my wound, and
was awakened on the following morning by the sound
of the college bell ringing for prayers.</p>

<p>Without losing a moment’s time I sprang out of
bed and scrambled into my clothes as best I could in
the few minutes I had to spare.</p>

<p>The night’s rest had refreshed me completely, and
had relieved my head of all sense of pain, although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
purple bruise had deepened in color, and the swelling
had scarcely diminished.</p>

<p>As I hurried down stairs and across the campus,
the last taps of the college bell were sounding, so that
I reached the chapel just as the doors were being
closed. A small crowd of tardy students were pressing
in, and they kept the main door open just long
enough to prevent my being shut out. I was the last
one in, and all alone I walked down the aisle to my
seat, the object of the curious gaze of over one hundred
and fifty pairs of eyes. This I was well accustomed
to, for I prided myself on the exactness with
which I could calculate the time needed to reach morning
prayers, and I was usually one of the very last
to enter.</p>

<p>But this morning my appearance must have been interesting,
and it certainly aroused attention. A
snicker ran along the lines of students as I passed
the various pews, and several of those nearest the aisle
plucked at my coat and gave vent to such whispered
exclamations as “Oh, what an eye!” “Who built that
lump on your forehead, Harry?” and so on.</p>

<p>As I took my seat Rod Emmons, who sat next to me,
said,</p>

<p>“That’s a bad bruise, Harry. How did you get
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I replied.</p>

<p>“What an answer!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“I mean it all the same,” I said. “I got that bruise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in the dark last night, and I am looking this morning
for the fellow that hit me.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by Professor
Fuller, who came forward to the pulpit at this moment,
and began prayers.</p>

<p>At the close, when the students were streaming out,
some to breakfast and others to recitations, I received
inquiries and expressions of sympathy from all sides;
but though I made no secret of my mishap, no one
seemed to know more of the affair than myself. As
the morning progressed without my obtaining any new
light on the subject, I concluded that the students
whom I had interrupted the night before must have
had a special reason for keeping silent.</p>

<p>“And besides,” I thought, “perhaps after all they
were not students at all, but town fellows trespassing
on the campus, and frightened off by my voice, thinking
I was the proctor.”</p>

<p>In the belief that the matter would solve itself, if a
solution was forthcoming, I decided to let it drop, and
accordingly gave up inquiring about it.</p>

<p>During the recitation hour between four and five
o’clock that afternoon, as I was speculating on the
chances of my being called upon next to recite, some
one nudged me, and a small, folded piece of paper
was slipped into my hand. This, on opening, I discovered
to be a note, which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi smcap">Dear Harry:</p>

<p>Meet me at the north entrance to Warburton Hall at five
o’clock sharp. Don’t fail, for I have something of importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
to tell you. Pass this word on to Tony Larcom. He must
be there, too.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours in haste,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Ray Wendell.</p>
</div>

<p>Tony was reciting at the time, and making a fine
botch of it, too, to the general amusement of the class.
The meeting of the evening before had evidently interfered
seriously with his preparation, for though he
was making a brave fight, Professor Fuller caught him
on a knotty question before which Tony’s wits availed
him nothing. So down he sat, as smiling and unabashed
as if he had scored a brilliant success. Then
I handed Ray Wendell’s note to my neighbor, and saw
it pass rapidly along the line. Tony read it, looked
toward me, and nodded his head.</p>

<p>Immediately after the recitation he joined us, and
together we hurried over toward Warburton Hall.
Ray Wendell was standing at the north entrance, evidently
awaiting us.</p>

<p>As we came up, Ray said,</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are prompt, for we’ve no time to
lose.”</p>

<p>At this moment Len Howard came down the stairs,
tennis racket in hand, and was about to pass us when
he saw Ray.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Wendell,” he said; “when can you play
tennis with me again?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Ray. “Baseball will
take all my time now, I think.”</p>

<p>“Then why not play me before the baseball season
sets in? Couldn’t we have a few sets to-morrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be away to-morrow,” said Ray.</p>

<p>“Then some time next week. How about Monday
noon?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say; I may be too busy.”</p>

<p>“See here, Wendell, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll
play you for fifty dollars a side, and put up the money
at once. Now, there’s a chance for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t play for money,” answered Ray coldly,
“and, to be perfectly frank, Howard, I don’t care particularly
to play at all. I understand that you had
money up on that last series of games, and——”</p>

<p>“Well, and what if I did?” broke in Howard. “Is
it any of your business?”</p>

<p>“It is none of my business whether you bet or not,
but it <em>is</em> some of my business whom I play tennis with,
and I say again, I don’t care to play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, you are afraid to play me,” said
Howard.</p>

<p>“If I wasn’t afraid to play you before, when I
thought you were the better player, why should I be
afraid now, when I know I can beat you?” rejoined
Ray, with a slightly sarcastic accent.</p>

<p>“You can’t beat me—it was all luck—you couldn’t
beat me again to save your life!” burst out Howard
excitedly. “I tell you I’ll bet you anything that——”</p>

<p>“And I tell you that I won’t bet anything, and
that baseball is all I have time for at present.” Here
Ray turned away.</p>

<p>Howard stood irresolute for a moment, as if about
to say something more; then wheeling sharply on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
his heel, he exclaimed with a sneer, “Oh, you’re a
coward!” and walked off.</p>

<p>Ray’s face flushed a moment as he looked after him.
Then he bit his lip, and, turning to Tony, said,</p>

<p>“I think, perhaps, you were right about him, after
all. He certainly seems to be nursing a grudge
against me for some reason. Perhaps I had better
play him again, and let him beat me badly. It might
do him good. Anything to please him, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wouldn’t help him much,” returned Tony,
“unless you let him win back the money he lost on
the last games with you.”</p>

<p>Ray made no answer to this, but caught up his notebooks,
which had been resting on a box behind the
door.</p>

<p>“Come up to my room,” he said, “I’ve a telegram
from Slade to show you,” and he led the way up stairs.</p>

<small>UNEXPECTED NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ray’s rooms were the handsomest in college, and
fully repaid in beauty and comfort the painstaking care
with which he had fitted them up. Ray’s father was
a well to do merchant in Albany, and, knowing his
son’s good sense and steady habits, had never hesitated
to supply him liberally with money. Ray was
thus able to fully gratify his love of comfortable and
tasteful surroundings, and had furnished his apartments
in a most attractive manner.</p>

<p>The floors, which were hard wood, were oiled, and
covered with rare and expensive rugs, the windows
were framed by portières of rich and heavy tapestry,
while the walls were hung with handsome pictures,
and the many little articles of bric à brac and mementos
of college life dear to every student’s heart.</p>

<p>His rooms were a source of great pride to Ray, and
a pleasurable treat to all of his college mates who
were in the habit of frequenting them. They had become
very familiar to me and were associated with
some of the most agreeable recollections of my college
life, for Ray Wendell, although a member of the class
ahead of me, was one of the oldest and best friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
I had in Belmont. Our acquaintance had been formed
upon the baseball field in my Freshman year, at the
time when I was first chosen member of the nine, and
this acquaintance had ripened into a genuine and lasting
friendship, which only grew firmer as time went
by, and which was strengthened on my part by a
warm and enthusiastic appreciation of Ray’s many
superior qualities of head and heart. This feeling I
shared with all who knew Ray Wendell well, and especially
with Tony Larcom, who would have followed
him through fire, if necessary.</p>

<p>As we entered his large front room and seated ourselves,
Ray took up a telegram, which lay upon his
desk, and handed it to Tony.</p>

<p>“There, what do you think of that?” he asked.</p>

<p>Tony read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The baseball convention will take place at the Wyman Hotel,
Berkeley, at 10:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right smcap">W. H. Slade.</p>
</div>

<p>There was silence for a moment as Tony looked up
in astonishment. Then his mouth opened.</p>

<p>“Gee whizz!” he exclaimed solemnly.</p>

<p>“No wonder you are surprised,” remarked Ray.
“You may imagine what I thought when I first
opened it.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is the most extraordinary and unexpected
summons I ever heard of,” I exclaimed. “Is
that the first notification you have had?”</p>

<p>“I knew nothing of the date of the meeting till I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
received this telegram. It was fortunate that I telegraphed
Slade early this morning, for we might have
missed the whole convention.”</p>

<p>“What a stupid, blundering oversight!” cried Tony.
“Just imagine a convention without any representatives
from Belmont!”</p>

<p>“Well,” responded Ray, “it would have been more
serious for <em>us</em> than the convention, for the other three
colleges would have constituted a quorum, and they
could have voted away our rights without our knowing
anything about it. I fancy the Park College
men would have been glad enough of a chance like
that to secure an advantage over us.”</p>

<p>“It was a contemptible trick, I believe,” burst out
Tony, tossing the telegram upon the desk.</p>

<p>I was inclined to be more reasonable.</p>

<p>“I can’t see the trick,” I said. “Slade is known
to be a very careful fellow. Had he been a Park
College man, I might have suspected him of underhand
work, but the Halford men have always been
friends.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think of it,” remarked Ray
thoughtfully, “but you may be sure I will sift the
matter to the bottom, and if there has been any
crooked work we’ll make things hum at that convention.
If it was merely negligence on Slade’s part, it
is too important to be overlooked. He would deserve
an early dismissal from his office for such carelessness.
Were we to miss the meeting, the damage to our interests
might be very great—but come, we can talk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
about that on the train. Our business now is to get
ready as fast as possible. You, Harry,” he continued,
turning to me, “said you needed only a few hours’
warning, and it turns out that is about all you’ll get.
Can you be ready for the 7:15 train?”</p>

<p>“Easily,” I responded. “I have only to pack a
small valise, and get my dinner.”</p>

<p>“And how about you?” to Tony.</p>

<p>“I’ll be at the station without fail,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“All right, then. Don’t forget to draw the necessary
money for expenses.”</p>

<p>“Why, I can’t do that. You know, the bank closes
at three o’clock,” answered Tony.</p>

<p>“To be sure, I had forgotten that,” said Ray.
“Well, then we will have to stand our own expenses,
and charge it up to the baseball association. Remember
to report your absence to Mr. Dikes. I have already
done so, and you had better go at once, for the
college offices close at six.”</p>

<p>I went immediately to the college offices, which
were on the first floor of Burke Hall, at the left hand
side of the main entrance, and just opposite the large
Latin room in which our meeting had been held the
night before.</p>

<p>Mr. Dikes was the registrar of the college, and, according
to the rules, students were obliged to report
to him before leaving town, in order that he might
keep a record of their whereabouts. Mr. Dikes was a
meek little man, but his office invested him with considerable
dignity and importance. His very name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
smacked of annual reports on behavior and grade, or
summons before the faculty and other formal notifications
that carried fear and consternation to the
guilty student’s heart. But, although his duties rendered
him an object of profound respect and even
awe, we liked Mr. Dikes none the less, for he was
always kind, gentle, and considerate, and never failed
to put in a good word for a student in trouble.</p>

<p>He was bending over a large ledger in which an
account of absentees was kept, when I entered the
office.</p>

<p>“I am going away, Mr. Dikes,” I said.</p>

<p>“Why, vacation will soon be here,” he answered,
looking up with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean merely for a day. I am going on the
7:15 train, and will return tomorrow evening.”</p>

<p>“Where do you go?” asked Mr. Dikes, getting
down from his high stool.</p>

<p>“To Berkeley.”</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>“You are going to the convention, I suppose. Mr.
Wendell reported this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I responded, “and you will get a report
from Tony Larcom, too, in a short time. He
goes with us.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Dikes, making a memorandum.
“Make sure we are given fair play at the convention.”</p>

<p>After a few more words, I hurried to my room and
packed my valise. Then I went to my eating club,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
which was situated some distance from the main street.
Tony Larcom, who was a member of the same club,
was there before me; and, as I entered, I found him
wrestling with an exceptionally refractory duck.</p>

<p>“If you expect to get the meat off that bird you’ll
never catch the 7:15 train,” said I, after watching his
efforts for a few moments.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for the meat; I’m doing this for
exercise,” he answered sarcastically. “Harry, just
think what a baseballist that duck would have made,
with its web feet to catch the balls, and all that muscle
to throw with——”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop your nonsense, and hurry up with your
dinner,” I answered. “We have only twenty minutes
to spare.”</p>

<p>Tony accordingly set to work in real earnest, and
we soon finished our meal, and were on our way to the
station.</p>

<p>Ray was already there when we arrived, and had
purchased tickets for the party. He was conversing
earnestly with Edwards, who had come down to see us
off, and the latter was listening with surprise to Ray’s
story about the telegram.</p>

<p>“I wish I could go over with you,” said Edwards.
“I would like to see the fun. Give me all the facts
when you come back, and if there has been any trickery
or negligence on the part of the officers of the
League, I will run off two or three columns in the next
issue of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> that will make their hair curl up
in knots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of the train, and so, bidding Edwards a hasty good
by, and assuring him that a full report of the proceedings
would be made to him on our return, we boarded
the cars, and soon left Belmont station far behind us.</p>

<p>Berkeley was situated ten miles from Belmont, and
on the banks of the same stream that flowed into our
lake, so that travel could be effected between the two
towns either by water or by rail, although the latter
was a far shorter route, for the small river Mahr
wound in and out amongst the picturesque hills of
Berkshire, almost doubling the distance to Berkeley.</p>

<p>The trip by rail took scarcely more than twenty-five
or thirty minutes, and this time was employed by us
in anticipating the business of the next day’s meeting.</p>

<p>As this was my first experience of the kind, I was
in no position to express positive opinions, but was
content to listen to the conversation of my two companions,
and to obtain from them all the information I
could concerning the various questions that would
come up for consideration in the convention.</p>

<p>The time passed quickly, therefore, and almost before
we were aware of it, the train slackened speed,
the door of the car opened, and the conductor shouted,</p>

<p>“Berkeley! All out for Berkeley!”</p>

<p>It was about ten minutes past eight when we
reached the Wyman House, which stood in the center
of the town and some distance from Park College,
the latter being situated nearly a quarter of a mile
from the town limits of Berkeley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>As Ray registered our names, some one touched him
on the shoulder. He turned and found himself face
to face with Slade. The latter held out his hand.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Wendell? I’m glad to see
you. I suppose you got my telegram all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Slade,” answered Ray coldly, “I got
your telegram; otherwise we might have missed the
convention altogether. Is it your custom to delay
notifying the delegates from the various colleges until
they telegraph and ask you when the meetings are
to take place?”</p>

<p>“‘Custom,’ Mr. Wendell?” exclaimed Slade in
amazement. “What do you mean? I have been secretary
of the League for two years, and you know my
custom well enough.”</p>

<p>“I know what your custom should be in notifying
us,” said Ray.</p>

<p>“And always has been,” added Slade with an accent
of annoyance. “Mr. Wendell, suppose we stop
this hinting. What is the meaning of your tone?”</p>

<p>“Why did you neglect to notify me of the date of
this meeting?” asked Ray.</p>

<p>“I did notify you,” was the instant response.</p>

<p>“Yes, by telegram to-day, after I had asked for the
information, but why did you fail to send me the customary
formal notification that should precede the
meeting by a week at least?”</p>

<p>Slade looked Ray steadily in the face for several seconds,
as if trying to determine whether he was in
earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell,” said he firmly, “there is evidently
some misunderstanding. <em>I sent you the regular notification
ten days ago.</em>”</p>

<p>Ray’s face changed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Slade, are you sure of that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why do you doubt it?” was the answer. “Have
I ever failed before? I tell you again, notifications
were sent to all the college delegates ten days ago,
and you among them. I was puzzled at receiving
your telegram of inquiry this morning, but supposed
that you had lost the notification and forgotten the
date. Do you mean to say you never received my letter?”</p>

<p>“Never,” answered Ray. “And are you sure you
did not overlook me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. See, here is the proof,” and Slade
opened the valise which he carried in his left hand,
and, taking out his letter book, hastily turned over the
pages. “I took the precaution of having those letters
copied, and mailed them myself.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the copy of a letter addressed to Ray,
dated ten days before. It contained the usual notification
of the meeting, and ended with</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Unless we hear from you to the contrary the committee will
consider this date as convenient to you.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2"><span class="smcap">Ernest Fitch</span>, Park Coll.,</span><br>
<i>Prest. of the League</i>.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr1"><span class="smcap">W. H. Slade</span>, Halford Coll.,</span><br>
<i>Sec. of the League</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>Ray read the letter through carefully. He then
said,</p>

<p>“Mr. Slade, I owe you an apology. I was too
hasty. I hope you will pardon me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Slade, with a smile. “You
can see that the fault is not mine, and there must have
been some hitch at your end of the line.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did you injustice,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>We spent the evening in the reading room and about
the lobby and piazza of the hotel, greeting the various
delegates that had arrived from Park, Halford, and
Dean Colleges, the three institutions which, with Belmont
College, had made up the Berkshire League.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>AN INTERCEPTED LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Promptly at 10:30 o’clock the following morning
the delegates assembled in the back parlor of the hotel,
which had been reserved for the convention. The
folding doors which connected it with the front parlor
were closed, and the meeting was called to order by
Ernest Fitch, the president of the League.</p>

<p>The officers of the Berkshire were chosen in the following
manner: at the close of each session a convention
was held for the special purpose of awarding
the Crimson Banner to the victorious college, and to
elect officers for the succeeding year. The plan was
therefore quite similar to that adopted by the several
colleges in choosing the officers for their association.
In the case of the League, the president was chosen
from the victorious college, and the secretary from the
college that held second place. Neither of these officers,
however, was to be a member of the nines of
the respective colleges. According to this custom,
therefore, Park College had the presidency in the
present season, and Halford College the secretaryship.</p>

<p>The meeting was not very lengthy, since only the
usual matters came up for discussion, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
disposed of quite readily, and without much controversy.
First we decided what kind of a ball we
should use, and in this we favored a well known firm
in New York. A few unimportant changes were
made in the rules, two or three professional umpires
were selected, and finally the schedule of games was
arranged. According to this schedule Belmont College
was listed to play championship games on the
second, third, and fourth Saturdays in May, and with
her opponents in the following order: first, Dean College;
second, Park College; and third, Halford College.</p>

<p>This completed the business of the meeting, which
occupied about two hours, so that when we adjourned
it was approaching one o’clock, and time to prepare
for lunch.</p>

<p>During the meal Tony Larcom looked over his time
table.</p>

<p>“We can easily catch the 2:30 train,” he said to
Ray. “What do you say to going back home?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” answered Ray. “I see no object
in hanging around here any longer.”</p>

<p>Accordingly we finished our lunch leisurely, and
then repaired to the piazza, where we sat down for
a few moments, awaiting the time to start for the station.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tony Larcom clapped Ray on the arm.</p>

<p>“Our valises!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ray and he rose together and reëntered the hotel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
As I was talking at that moment with Slade, I did not
accompany them, but called out,</p>

<p>“Bring down my valise, too, will you, Tony?”</p>

<p>Tony called back an assent, and I continued in conversation.</p>

<p>“You have quite a bruise on your head, Mr. Elder.
Did you get hit with a ball?” asked Slade, examining
my forehead.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered; “I was kicked in the head by
some one running over me—at least, I think so,
though it was late at night, and too dark for me to be
sure.”</p>

<p>As we continued to talk about the matter, Slade said
in a low tone, looking over my shoulder,</p>

<p>“Somebody is very much interested in you, I
think.”</p>

<p>I turned sharply around, to encounter the full,
steady stare of a young fellow about my own age, who
had been standing about three feet behind me.</p>

<p>He lowered his eyes, and at once passed into the
hotel.</p>

<p>I looked after him curiously.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” responded Slade. “I think he is
a Park College fellow; at least, he came into town
this morning with quite a crowd of students from the
college. He was fairly devouring you with his eyes
when I spoke.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it will do him good, though I don’t
see why he——” Here I was interrupted by Tony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
who came out quickly and thrust my valise into my
hand.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “We must hurry.”</p>

<p>As I turned to shake hands with Slade, I saw the
fellow who had attracted our attention standing in the
doorway still gazing fixedly at me, but the moment my
eyes met his he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>“And now,” began Ray, when we were seated in
the train, “we must make up our nine without delay.
It will be an embarrassment of riches and no easy task
to choose, I think, for we have some mighty fine players
on the class nines. Suppose you come to my
room to-night just after dinner, and we will make a
start. Of course there are some men who stand no
chance, and would only be in the way, so the best
plan, I think, is to select from the class nines twenty
of the likely men, and invite them to compete for the
’Varsity. We can post this list on the bulletin board
Monday morning, and get down to practice without
delay.”</p>

<p>This seemed an excellent idea, and so, when we arrived
at Belmont, we separated at the station with the
understanding that we three were to meet at Ray’s
room early that evening.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner I went to the post office
to obtain any letters that might have arrived during
the day. Nothing but a newspaper from home was
in my box, so, on receiving this, I was about to walk
away when I heard a familiar voice, and, turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
around, I saw Ray Wendell in conversation with the
postmaster.</p>

<p>As I came up and took hold of his arm, the postmaster
was saying,</p>

<p>“I really don’t see how I can help you, Mr. Wendell.
If your letter arrived—and I have no doubt it
did—it was properly looked after. We make no mistakes.
I do not, of course, remember every letter,
but I have quite a firm recollection of such a
letter as you describe—in a pink envelope—and it
was given to Ridley to deliver.”</p>

<p>Ridley was the young colored boy who carried the
mail for the occupants of Warburton Hall.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Ray, “then I’ll have to question
Ridley.”</p>

<p>“That is the most likely quarter to find the mistake,”
said the postmaster. “Perhaps he delivered it
to the wrong party, or dropped it.”</p>

<p>Ray turned away.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Harry,” said he to me. “You see, I am
tracing up that letter. I’d give anything to know
where the blame lies.”</p>

<p>“Probably on Ridley, as the postmaster suggests,”
I responded. “You know he is nothing but a small
boy, and liable to be careless at times.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will see. Come on over to my room,”
and Ray linked his arm in mine.</p>

<p>When we reached the entrance to Warburton Hall,
Ray went to the head of the stairs that led down into
the cellar, and called into the darkness,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo, Ridley!”</p>

<p>After repeated calls, there was a sound in the regions
below. First came the hollow clang of an iron
shovel, then the crash of a coal scuttle, and the noise
of scattering coal, accompanied by muttered exclamations
of a character that betokened disaster. Finally,
out of the cellar, and as black as the darkness he left
behind him, came the unlucky Ridley, his coat off,
his woolen shirt torn, and rubbing his shins where
they had come to grief against the coal scuttle. He
looked like a veritable imp of the night as he stood
there in the glare of the single gas jet that lighted
the hallway. Ray looked at him with mock severity.</p>

<p>“Ridley!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The boy looked at Ray beseechingly, shifted uneasily
from foot to foot, and finally, unable to withstand
Ray’s fixed gaze, he snuffled violently.</p>

<p>“I ain’t dun nuffin,” he mumbled.</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” said Ray, with a half
smile, as he took the boy by the ear. “Now, Ridley,
listen to me. Do you remember that very rainy
Wednesday of last week?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember getting the mail that morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember any letters for me that morning?”</p>

<p>“No, sah.”</p>

<p>“No letters for me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>“Dere wan’t no letters for you that mawnin, sah.”</p>

<p>“Ridley!” exclaimed Ray, with real severity this
time. “There <em>was</em> a letter for me in that mail. Now,
what became of it?”</p>

<p>Ridley was growing more and more frightened, but
no sign of guilt appeared on his ebony countenance.</p>

<p>“I’s tellin’ no lies, Mistah Wendell. I swar to
golly I’s tellin’ no lies. Der wan’t no letter for you.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you remember the mail?” asked Ray.</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, perfeckly.”</p>

<p>“Who had letters that morning?”</p>

<p>“Dere was only five or six letters. I didn’t look
at ’em at de post offiss, but when I kem up to de door
right here, Mistah—le’s see, who was it?—Mistah,
Mistah, oh, Mistah Howard was standin’ by de doorway.”</p>

<p>“Howard was there, was he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, an’ he sez, ‘Ridley, hev ye got de mail?’
an’ I sez, ‘Yes, sah,’ an’ he sez, ‘Let me look at it,’ an’
I gived de letters ter him——”</p>

<p>“You gave the letters to Howard that morning?
Ridley, are you sure?” exclaimed Ray, letting go of
the boy.</p>

<p>“Perfeckly. Mistah Howard took de letters, an’ he
luks ’em over, an’ he sez, ‘Dese two is mine,’ an’ he
gives me back de rest.”</p>

<p>“He kept two, did he? Well, did you see those
letters?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, I didn’t see de names. He gived me back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
t’ree or four, and none of <em>dem</em> was fer you. I s’posed
Mistah Howard unly kep’ his own letters.”</p>

<p>“And there were two of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, I knows dere was two; one was white an’
de udder pink.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Ray. “You say one was <em>pink</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah. I remember dat letter well. I tuk notiss
of it wen I got it at de post office, and when Mistah
Howard gived me back de udder letters dat pink
one was gone.”</p>

<p>Ray was silent for several minutes, his lips pressed
firmly together. At length he said quietly.</p>

<p>“All right, Ridley. Much obliged to you. That
will do.” Ridley disappeared down the cellar stairs,
and Ray turned to me a long look of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Well, what—do—you—think—of that?” he
asked slowly. I shook my head.</p>

<p>“And so Howard took that letter!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“So it seems,” Ray answered, “and I must say it
takes my breath away. Whatever may have been said
of Howard, I never thought him a petty thief.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Ray Wendell!” cried a voice just behind
us.</p>

<p>We both started and turned about.</p>

<p>Not six feet away stood Len Howard.</p>

<p>We were somewhat taken aback by this sudden and
unexpected appearance of the very individual whose
name was upon our lips. Silence reigned for several
seconds.</p>

<p>At the first sound of Howard’s voice, Ray, like myself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
had been startled. He quickly recovered himself,
however, and looked Howard quietly and firmly
in the face. The latter’s expression was angry and
belligerent.</p>

<p>“Did I hear my name a few moments ago?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you did. Your name was mentioned,”
Ray answered.</p>

<p>“And do I understand that you apply the name
thief to me?”</p>

<p>“My words were quite plain, I think,” responded
Ray.</p>

<p>“I think not. I think they need considerable explanation,”
said Howard, moving a little nearer.</p>

<p>“That depends upon how much of our conversation
you have heard,” answered Ray. “If you were here
when I questioned Ridley a few moments ago, I hardly
think any explanation is needed.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Howard had not overheard all
that had been said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about Ridley,” he rejoined
in a louder tone of voice; “but I know that you have
called me a thief, and I intend to have satisfaction
for it.”</p>

<p>“Satisfaction!” echoed Ray, his lip curling.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” continued Howard, growing
bolder and more threatening as he saw how quiet his
opponent was. He made, however, a great mistake in
taking Ray’s calmness of manner as an indication of
timidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>He coolly measured Howard from head to foot with
a glance of contempt.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean, Howard, by <em>satisfaction</em>?”
he said. “You simply amaze me. You stoop
low enough to rob my mail, and then, when you overhear
me accusing you of the theft, you have the audacity
to ask for <em>satisfaction</em>! What right have you
to satisfaction? It is I that want satisfaction. I am
the one who was wronged.”</p>

<p>Howard winced perceptibly as the mail was mentioned,
but by the time Ray had stopped speaking, he
had entirely recovered himself, and seemed even angrier
and more aggressive than before.</p>

<p>“Mail!” he burst out. “What mail have I
robbed? What letters of yours have I taken? Ray
Wendell, take care how you accuse me of stealing——”</p>

<p>Howard’s hardihood was exasperating to Ray.
That he had taken the letter was beyond doubt, and
now that he should stand there and boldly deny it was
almost more than Ray’s patience could stand.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be gained by dodging in this
manner, Howard,” he said. “You understand me
perfectly. You know that you took from Ridley last
week that letter which I and the college had been expecting
from Slade, relating to the date of the convention.
What your reasons may have been I can
only guess, but that you robbed my mail is beyond
question.”</p>

<p>“It’s an infernal lie!” shouted Howard, closing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
fists threateningly, “and I’ll make you eat your words,
I’ll make you——”</p>

<p>“You’ll do <em>what</em>?” exclaimed Ray, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you not to accuse me of stealing,” he
went on fiercely. “Why, what do you suppose I
should want with your paltry letters?”</p>

<p>“Never mind discussing the reasons,” cried Ray, his
temper now well up. “I say you stole that letter.”</p>

<p>“And I say you are a liar——”</p>

<p>The words had barely escaped Howard’s lips when
Ray leaped forward and seized him by the throat.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>OPEN ENEMIES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The onslaught was so sudden that Howard was almost
taken off his feet. He was dashed back against
the wall and shaken until he was nearly breathless.
When he was almost strangling, Ray loosened his grip
somewhat, but still held him firmly by the throat,
pressing him against the wall.</p>

<p>“There, you cowardly sneak,” he said, “don’t try
to bully me any longer. Now after this leave my mail
alone.”</p>

<p>With these words Ray released him. Howard, who
was thoroughly frightened, sank almost to his knees,
and crouched there for several seconds, breathing
heavily. Then, as his breath gradually returned to
him, he recovered himself, straightened up, and
smoothed out his rumpled collar, while his face took
on an evil expression.</p>

<p>“All right, Ray Wendell,” he said, panting. “We
understand each other. I’ll be even with you fifty
times over for this——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you do,” retorted Ray, interrupting
him.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you already gone far enough, Howard?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
said I. “Can’t you see that every word you say only
makes matters worse? What do you suppose the fellows
will say when they hear of this?”</p>

<p>Howard paused a moment. The humiliating results
of such an exposure dawned upon him. He struggled
to master himself, and finally said in an altered tone:</p>

<p>“I didn’t intend to steal the letter. I didn’t notice
it was Wendell’s till Ridley had gone away. I
didn’t open it. I saw it was from the baseball League,
so I tossed it on the box behind the door where Wendell
usually puts his books.”</p>

<p>On hearing this I immediately looked behind the
door, but found nothing. If the letter had been
thrown there it had been swept away during the week.</p>

<p>“It is of little importance whether you opened it
or not,” said Ray coldly. “The result is just the same
in either case. You knew the contents, and you purposely
prevented my getting it.”</p>

<p>Howard was about to say something more, but suddenly
concluded to accept my advice and keep silent.
His lame explanation had not helped matters at all, so,
turning hastily, he walked away into the darkness of
the campus, while Ray and I started up stairs.</p>

<p>“Well, if you ever had any doubts about your relations
to Howard they should be removed now,” I said.
“You have made an enemy of him for once and all.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than he has been in the past, I
imagine,” answered Ray. “Only he is open about the
matter now. And to think that all this started with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
few games of tennis—at least I suppose so, for Howard
was friendly enough to me previous to that.”</p>

<p>We reached Ray’s door as his last words were
spoken. This recalled to us the business we had in
view for the evening, and Ray looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Tony turn up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think he will be here in a few minutes,” I answered.
“I saw him shortly before I met you and
he said he would be on hand promptly.”</p>

<p>We had scarcely seated ourselves when Tony entered,
whistling a popular tune with all the strength
and fervor, and about as much expression as a fog
horn. The whistle stopped short when Tony saw our
faces, and judged correctly from our expressions that
something unusual had happened. I described in a
few words the scene that had taken place down stairs.</p>

<p>“Why, the rascally scamp!” exclaimed Tony when
I had finished. “You ought to expose him before the
whole college.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” interrupted Ray. “What could we gain
by that? We could scarcely make Howard more unpopular
than he is now, and, besides, granted that we
could, I don’t believe in that sort of revenge. I would
rather let the matter rest just as it is, and I wish
neither of you would say anything about it.”</p>

<p>“But I think we ought to expose him for the protection
of the rest of the college, so that all the fellows
may know what a thief he is,” urged Tony.</p>

<p>“Now that is just where you make the mistake,
Tony,” said Ray. “You would do Howard a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
injustice, for you would spread the impression that
he was a regular thief, while my belief is that his purpose
was simply to prevent my getting that letter, and
his act was prompted not by dishonest inclinations so
much as a feeling of enmity against me.”</p>

<p>Tony was not satisfied on the point, however; nor
was I, in fact, but as Ray urged us, we agreed to say
nothing about the matter, although we felt that Wendell
was acting with entirely too much generosity.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Ray, drawing his chair up to the
desk and taking up pen and paper, “let us get to work
at these baseball candidates. Suppose each of you
take a sheet of paper and write down the names of,
say, twenty-five of the men you think to be the most
likely competitors for places on the nine. Then we
will compare our lists, and if we find that we have
agreed upon twenty men we will post their names in
the gymnasium and on the bulletin board in Burke
Hall, with a formal request that they present themselves
without delay if they desire to compete for the
vacant positions.”</p>

<p>“And how about the others?” I asked. “Do you
suppose there will be any offense taken by any one at
being excluded from the competition?”</p>

<p>Ray thought a moment. Then he said,</p>

<p>“Oh, we can word the bulletin in such a way as to
avoid all chance of giving offense. We can say ‘the
following are particularly invited to compete for the
vacant positions on the University nine,’ and then we
can insert a phrase something to the effect that ‘others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
wishing to enter as competitors will please make
known their purpose to the captain.’ Putting it in
that way will serve as a gentle hint to others that
those on the list are preferred. The college understands
the matter, I think. The fellows know that
we are not trying to make a close corporation of it,
but only aim to make it easier for those who stand a
fair show to be chosen. Last year, as everybody remembers,
a great deal of money and time was wasted
on a shoal of men who stood no chance of getting on
the nine at all, and who knew it too, only they wanted
to get the advantage of our training and practice.
This plan of mine is merely a polite way of hinting
to such outsiders that they must get their exercise
some other way than by interfering with the practice
of the men who really mean business—and I think
the hint will be appreciated by the college at large.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” commented Tony, as he thought of
the low condition of the treasury, “for we have not
enough money to meet the necessary expenses of the
nine. I’m going to start that subscription list early
Monday morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you will feel better, Tony, after the
Glee Club Concert,” answered Ray with a smile. “I
think that will set us on our feet again—and now
take your pencils and make up your lists.”</p>

<p>Then he handed us each a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>There was a silence for several moments only
broken by the scratching of pen and pencils. At
length we finished, and laying our lists upon the desk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
we set to work comparing them. It soon became evident
that our views coincided very closely, and the
final result of our examination showed that we had
all three agreed upon twenty-two names. These men
were all good players who had shown their proficiency
in the class games of the fall previous, and several of
them were sure of places on the University nine.</p>

<p>“Well, let it stand then at twenty two, since we
have agreed on that number,” said Ray, “and now let
me draw up a form for the bulletin, and then see what
you think of it.”</p>

<p>Ray wrote busily for some time.</p>

<p>“We must be prompt, you know,” he said, as he
finished, “for we must choose the nine just before the
Easter vacation, so I have requested competitors to be
at the ball ground Monday noon in order that we can
begin practice at once.”</p>

<p>Ray then read us what he had written. Several
changes were made, and the matter rewritten several
times before it was in a shape satisfactory to us all.
When finally completed, Ray handed the sheet of paper
to Tony.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “will you make two clean copies
of that, Tony, and have them posted up the first thing
Monday morning?”</p>

<p>Tony consented, and we rose to go. As I lingered
at the door after Tony had taken his departure, Ray
suddenly said,</p>

<p>“By the way, Harry, what are you going to do this
Easter vacation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing in particular,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, I have a brilliant scheme to propose then,”
he continued. “You know I never did like the effect
the Easter vacations have on the nine. It demoralizes
them and I want to lessen the evil as much as
possible this year. Now here you are, Dick Palmer,
and myself: pitcher, catcher, and a second baseman,
who, if you take hold of my idea, can keep in splendid
trim.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what is your idea?” I asked with interest.</p>

<p>“Suppose both of you come down home with me
for the vacation. It is a pleasant country place, and
we will do nothing but exercise and practice, so that
by the time we return, we will be in fine shape. I’ll
promise you lots of fun in the bargain, so you’d better
accept. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’d like nothing better,” I answered, “and I’ll
write home about it at once. Summer vacation is so
near that I think my people can spare me this one
week. Have you asked Dick Palmer?”</p>

<p>“No, for I just thought of the scheme this moment.
I will speak to him, however, without delay,
for it will be a rare chance to get in good practice, and
I don’t think we ought to miss it. We’ll have a fine
time.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, and for my part, I need no urging,
for I should be delighted to go. I will let you know
about it in a day or so,” I said, as we parted company
for the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>CHOOSING THE NINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Early on the Monday morning following, I went
over to Burke Hall to see if the bulletin had been
posted on the great board fastened against the wall
of the main hallway. I found not only our bulletin,
but a large crowd of students assembled in front of
it, and from their comments I soon became convinced
that both our notice and our selection of men for the
competition were satisfactory. The college was always
generous and sympathetic in its support of the
nine, and followed its progress with interest and encouragement.
At noon a large number of the students
accompanied the competitors down to the baseball
field, which was situated about a quarter of a mile
from the college, eager to witness the first day’s practice,
and to speculate on the merits of the respective
men.</p>

<p>The club house had been opened a week or so before,
and had been thoroughly renovated and cleaned,
preparatory to the beginning of the season. The two
assistants who kept things in order about the place,
looked after the bats and other articles, and rubbed us
down after exercise, had also been re-engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>This latter expense had cost Tony a good deal of
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Just think of my nerve,” he confided to me.
“Here I was re-engaging those two fellows, with only
about forty dollars in the treasury. I hardly dared
look them in the face. If the college doesn’t back us
up handsomely, the nine will have to go into pawn before
the first month has passed.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; don’t fret about that,” I answered.
“We had to have the men, and the college knows it.
The money will come fast enough. Have you started
that subscription list yet?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have,” was Tony’s prompt response. “I
could hardly wait till this morning to begin canvassing.
I was up about half past seven, posting those bulletins,
and then I set out at once for victims. There
weren’t many fellows up at that hour, but I saw one
lone creature making his way across the campus, and
I swooped down on him like a wolf, subscription list
in one hand and pencil in the other. Well, who do
you think it was? Nobody but Reddy Weezner.
You know what an old skinflint he is. How was that
for a tough nut to begin with. You ought to have
seen his face when he heard my errand. He turned
fairly green. You see he hadn’t had his breakfast,
and I suppose he felt kind o’ weak to run up against
a subscription fiend. I determined to hang to him,
however, and get some money out of the encounter.
And what do you think? I made him shell out!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that Reddy Weezner contributed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
something?” I exclaimed in amused astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Tony in high glee. “The
first time on record. Reddy Weezner contributed, and
what is more astonishing, he gave <em>three dollars</em>.
Think of that! I suppose if he had eaten his breakfast
he might have had the courage to refuse, but he
didn’t stand any show with me at that hour of the
morning. Oh, Reddy Weezner is all right. He may
be a hard nut to crack, but when he does crack he
cracks wide open. But it was fun to see him totter
off when I got through with him. I suppose he will
kick himself for a month for his generosity.”</p>

<p>“How does your list stand?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Very well, considering the short time I’ve been
at work on it. I’ve collected thirty dollars, and I’m
not more than a quarter through the list. You go
on into the club house and get ready for practice, and
I’ll strike the crowd while the fellows are in the humor.”</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of genuine affection that I unwrapped
my old baseball suit which I had brought
down with me from my trunk, where it had lain
through the winter, and arranged my things in my
locker preparatory to a new season. Of the old nine
that had assembled in the club house in the previous
year, only two besides myself now remained, but these
were my best friends—Dick Palmer and Ray Wendell.
Other than those, I saw about me only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
faces of new men, some of whom I felt sure would be
improvements on our last year’s team.</p>

<p>I had little time for such reflections, however, for
the others were already on the field, so I hurriedly
dressed myself and went out on the diamond, where
the new grass lay as smooth and evenly trimmed as
velvet.</p>

<p>During the preliminary competition the manner in
which we practised was as follows:</p>

<p>The competitors were divided into two companies—those
who were competing for positions in the infield,
and those who were competing for positions in the
outfield.</p>

<p>The former stood in a group and received each in
turn a ground ball batted by some one who stood about
a hundred feet distant from them.</p>

<p>Beside this batter stood a competitor for first base
position, with his gloves on, who caught the ball as it
was sharply returned to him by the others. The practice
would thus progress with the regularity of clockwork.
Each man in his turn would step forward,
receive the ground ball struck by the batter, return
it quickly to the competitor for first base who stood
beside the batter, and then give place to the next man.</p>

<p>The practice of the outfielders was conducted at another
part of the field. The man stood out at a
considerable distance from a batter who struck balls
high into the air in various directions. Here, as in
the infield, the competitors took turn, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the ball at once with all their force to a catcher who
stood beside the batter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the diamond, Dick Palmer and I
held our positions as catcher and pitcher respectively,
while all the men came up in groups of four and took
turns in batting. This served as practice for Dick
and myself, and also enabled us to judge of the batting
abilities of the various men. Ray Wendell moved
about from one part of the field to the other, watching
the men carefully, in order that he might arrive at a
fair judgment of their respective merits. This sort
of work constituted our daily practice until the nine
was chosen, which choice usually took place just before
the Easter vacation.</p>

<p>The competition this year was, from the first, sharp
and close, for there were many positions to be filled,
and the men were for the most part quite evenly
matched. As the days passed, however, the competition
narrowed down somewhat. A few dropped out,
and some developed more rapidly than others, so that
by Saturday it would not have been so difficult a task
to pick out the likely new members of the nine.</p>

<p>On Saturday night the Glee Club concert took
place. The large examination room on the top floor
of Burke Hall had been decorated especially for the
purpose and the floor filled with chairs. The concert
was a brilliant musical as well as financial success.
The club had been carefully trained, and sang with
great spirit and dash. The audience was large and
enthusiastic, consisting chiefly of the students and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
professors’ families, with a generous sprinkling of
town people. Every number was encored, and the
singers were compelled to introduce many additional
features, which they did with a good will that made
the entertainment delightful throughout. It seemed
to me that the old college songs never had sounded
so sweet as when sung that night at our baseball benefit.
The other members of the nine must have shared
my feelings; and as for Tony, his beaming face fairly
lighted up the lower end of the hall.</p>

<p>Before the entertainment was over I made my way
toward him with a view to securing definite information
concerning our finances. Tony seemed wrapped
in an ecstatic revery as I approached. No doubt he
was dreaming of the riches that lay in the strong tin
box on which he was sitting, and which were soon to
be deposited in the treasury of the baseball association.</p>

<p>“Well, Tony,” I whispered, nudging him, “how
are the funds now? Have you got rid of your uneasiness
about hiring those men?”</p>

<p>“Harry,” answered Tony, “I got rid of that some
days ago when I finished my subscription list at $120.
I am thinking now of hiring a corps of servants and
a brass band to accompany us on our tour. How
much do you think there is in this box?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. Tony leaned forward and whispered
impressively,</p>

<p>“Over $300. And that, with the $120 I have collected
and the $40 already on hand, makes it $460.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you are happy now,” I said, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“But what are you going to do with that $300
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as soon as Maynard, the treasurer of the Glee
Club, comes back we are going to take it down stairs.
Mr. Dikes said that we might put it in his safe over
Sunday.”</p>

<p>The proceeds from the concert far exceeded my expectations,
and placed our association upon a secure
financial basis. The amount now in the treasury
would alone cover all expenses and carry us through
the season, to say nothing of our share in the proceeds
from the various games.</p>

<p>Easter vacation began on the following Saturday,
accordingly, on Thursday night, Dick Palmer, Tony,
and I met at Ray’s rooms by appointment to choose
the nine. There was but little difference of opinion
among us, and a little more than half an hour sufficed
to select the names.</p>

<p>Of course this choice was at first experimental, and
subject to change if any man disappointed us. In
order that we might have a number of substitutes to
fall back upon, the other competitors were organized
into a second nine with which the University team
was to play practice games every day. In this way
every man was put on his mettle to hold the position
he had gained.</p>

<p>As in the case of the first bulletin, the announcement
of the nine was posted up the following morning in
Burke Hall. The names and positions of the men
were as follows:</p>

<p>A short meeting of the new nine was held at five
o’clock on Friday afternoon, when Ray gave them
general instruction concerning practice and training,
and directed them to be on hand at the grounds at
noon on the Monday following vacation.</p>

<p>“You must remember,” he said, “that the real work
has only begun, so you must all buckle to and do
everything in your power to help things along. One
thing I want you all to observe in particular: leave
individual interests alone, and play solely for the nine.
Profit by last year’s experience. We had good individual
players, but some of them were uncongenial,
and some of them were working solely for individual
record, so we did not have a good nine. What we
want this year is perfect harmony, and I want each
one of you to help me to secure it. If you do that I
have no fear for the result.”</p>

<p>If any one was calculated to secure this harmony
it was Ray Wendell, for, without being in the least
dictatorial, he had perfect command over the members
of the nine, and we were all in thorough accord
with him.</p>

<p>During the week I had received word from home
that I might accept Ray’s invitation, and as Dick Palmer
had also accepted, we had an extremely pleasant
outlook for the vacation. Although Tony Larcom
was not necessary to our plans, Ray Wendell could
not resist asking him to join us, and accordingly it
was a very jolly party of four that set out on the
following day for Albany. On reaching that city we
changed cars and rode some distance down the Hudson
River, alighting at a small way station, where a
carriage met us and transported us to Cedar Hill, the
handsome summer home of Mr. Wendell.</p>

<p>Ray’s parents received us hospitably, and did everything
to make our week a pleasant one. The days
passed rapidly in various delightful country pursuits.
We did not forget the main object of our coming together,
however, but practised hard at baseball for
several hours each day. The result was that at the
end of the vacation, which had flown by only too
rapidly, we were playing in splendid form, and were
in the best possible condition physically. The week
was a perfect paradise to Tony, who enjoyed every
minute of it, and during our hours of practice, he
stood by, an interested spectator, and chased all the
wild balls like a good fellow.</p>

<p>Early on the Monday morning following the Easter
holidays we left Cedar Hill and returned to college.
We reached Belmont shortly after ten o’clock, and
were hurrying to our rooms to unpack our valises,
when we were attracted by the sound of voices on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
front campus. Rounding the corner of Colver Hall,
we saw a great mass of students assembled near the
front gateway, many of them talking loudly and gesticulating
in an excited manner.</p>

<p>“Hallo, what’s all this?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Something unusual, that’s certain,” said Dick
Palmer. “Come, let’s hurry and see what is the matter.”</p>

<p>Hastily tossing our valises into a corner of the
entry to Colver Hall, we ran down toward the crowd,
and pushed our way through to the open space in the
center.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” I asked the nearest man.</p>

<p>“Trouble! Trouble enough. It’s a burning
shame!” he exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>“What is a burning shame?”</p>

<p>“Why look! Look there,” and he pointed to the
ground.</p>

<p>We looked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p><em>The old cannons—the pets of which Belmont had
been so proud for forty years past—were gone.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>A COUNCIL OF WAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Almost unable to believe my eyes, I gazed fixedly
at the damp, bare spots of ground where our dear old
cannons had rested for so long a time. Like all the
students at Belmont I had grown so accustomed to
the old pieces of artillery, and they had become so intimately
associated with my college life, that I had
learned to look upon them as a part of the institution
itself, and I could not get used to the fact that they
were gone—that the two Belmont cannons had actually
been moved away, and that I was simply staring
at vacancy. It all seemed so unreal, that for a moment
I wondered whether I was awake or dreaming.
As if in echo to my thoughts, I heard Dick Palmer’s
voice beside me.</p>

<p>“The old cannons gone! Why, it doesn’t seem
like Belmont College now.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tony Larcom, “it isn’t the same
place at all. The campus looks as if it had had two
big front teeth pulled out.”</p>

<p>“Then we must set about refilling the cavities,”
said some one.</p>

<p>We looked around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Clinton Edwards was standing with his hand on
Ray Wendell’s shoulder. It was to Ray in particular
that he addressed the words. Ray said nothing.</p>

<p>Edwards shook Ray’s shoulder slightly.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It staggers me,” answered Ray slowly. “Who
could have taken them? Where have they gone?”</p>

<p>“To Park College,” said Edwards.</p>

<p>My heart leaped at these words. Vague suspicions
that had been haunting my mind for days past
now suddenly became confirmed.</p>

<p>“How do you know the cannons are there?” questioned
Ray as he started and turned around.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it clear enough?” responded Edwards.
“Remember that threatening letter, and the ‘positive
stand’ they said they had determined to take in the
matter. Who would take the cannons but the Park
men? If you want further proof, do as I did an
hour ago—follow the deep wheel tracks down to the
dock by the boathouse, and then ask old Jerry Bunce
about the steam tug which he saw coming down from
Berkeley night before last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is all too clear now,” I burst out. “Everything
is explained—the letter, and those two fellows
whom I frightened away from the cannons the night
of the mass meeting. They were undoubtedly a reconnoitering
party from Berkeley—and then that fellow
who stared me out of face on the piazza of the Wyman
House—he must have been one of them, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
overheard my words to Slade about the bruise on my
forehead.”</p>

<p>There was a silence in the group for a few seconds.
Attracted by our words the greater part of the crowd
had by this time gathered closely about us. From a
noisy, clamorous indignation meeting the crowd gradually
shaped itself into a council of war, of which we
formed the center.</p>

<p>Of this council, Clinton Edwards was one of the
ruling spirits. No student in Belmont possessed more
college feeling or was more vigorously patriotic than
Edwards. He was an active leader in all that concerned
the best interests of the students.</p>

<p>Another prominent member of our group was Percy
Randall, fully as patriotic a student as Edwards, but
more reckless. Randall was a jolly scamp, nearly
always in some scrape or other, very generally liked
and admired on account of his dashing, happy go
lucky manner, and the chosen head of a select set of
mischief makers that kept the college constantly guessing
what would happen next. At a moment like this
Randall was in his element, and the contemptible trick
that the Park men had played upon us made the fellows
only too eager to accept a leadership like his.</p>

<p>“Of all the mean, dastardly, cowardly pieces of
work this is the worst,” he exclaimed. “Just think
of it, fellows; like a lot of pusillanimous sneaks they
steal over here by night, in vacation time, while we
are away, and drag off our cannons. Oh, I wish a
few of us had been here. It would have taken only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
about fifteen or twenty of us to have cleaned out half
their college.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t have come had there been any of
us here. Even proctor Murray was on his vacation,”
said Edwards. “It was a mean piece of work, but
they planned it well, and here we are without our
cannons.”</p>

<p>“But we’re not going to sit down and nurse the
loss,” exclaimed Randall. “There is only one thing
to do in my mind.”</p>

<p>“And in mine too,” echoed Edwards quietly.</p>

<p>“And that is?” asked Dick Palmer.</p>

<p>“Go and bring them back!” cried Randall.</p>

<p>There was a roar of applause.</p>

<p>“And how shall we do it?” asked one.</p>

<p>“How!” answered Randall boldly. “How!
There is only one way. Organize a party, go over
to Berkeley, and take the cannons away from them.”</p>

<p>“And bring the whole college down on us in a
mass?” said Edwards.</p>

<p>“Who cares?” exclaimed Randall. “Let them
come down, and we will wipe out the whole gang of
them. I’d like nothing better than a chance like that.
We’ll teach them to meddle with Belmont College
men.”</p>

<p>“All well enough in spirit, Percy, but it <em>won’t work</em>.
We can’t get the cannons that way,” said Edwards.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you’re going to sit tamely
by and do nothing?” asked Randall.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“Will you go over to Berkeley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not in the way you propose,” answered
Edwards.</p>

<p>“Any way then, just so we go,” said Randall.</p>

<p>Edwards was looking at Ray Wendell. He knew
what an influence Ray’s voice would exert, and he
felt sure of Ray’s feelings in the matter.</p>

<p>“Will you join us?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Join whom and what?”</p>

<p>“I propose that we organize a party of say fifty—it
would be hard to handle more—go over to Berkeley
this very night late, search out those cannons, take
them from right under the snoring noses of those Park
men, and bring them back.”</p>

<p>“How shall we carry them?”</p>

<p>“Easily enough; by boat as they did. We can hire
Jerry Bunce’s excursion boat for the night for twenty
five or thirty dollars. We will go down the river to
the landing near Park College, search for the cannons
right on their campus, where no doubt they are, and
drag them down to the boat, loose our moorings, and
off we’ll go. There, what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>Ray’s face was flushing with excitement. His
anger at the outrage perpetrated upon us, his feeling
of college honor, and his love of adventure, combined,
left him no room for hesitation.</p>

<p>“I will go,” he said promptly. “I only waited for
some clearly defined plan. Your idea is a good one.
I believe we can make it a success.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll join us?” said Edwards quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, by all means.”</p>

<p>“Good, and you too?” he continued looking at
Tony, Dick Palmer, and myself. We assented at
once.</p>

<p>“Who else?” called out Edwards.</p>

<p>A chorus of voices responded eagerly.</p>

<p>“This won’t do,” said Ray. “We can’t go over in
a mob, without discipline. That would spoil our
chances. We must pick out and organize a regular
party as Edwards proposed, and fifty would be
enough. Who will make up the company?”</p>

<p>“Let Percy Randall look after that,” suggested Edwards,
“and we can arrange the other details. First
let us see Jerry Bunce and obtain the use of his boat.
We will fix the hour of departure at eleven o’clock
to-night—not at our dock, for proctor Murray will
be back this afternoon and he would see us. We
will have the boat anchored around the bend down the
river just beyond Packer’s woods, and the fellows
must go through the town by twos and threes so as
not to arouse suspicion. There will be a rowboat at
the shore to take us aboard——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Edwards,” said I. “Suppose you can’t
get the steamer? You speak as if it was definitely
arranged.”</p>

<p>“I do so,” he answered, “in order that we may
not have to meet again. I don’t think there will be
any trouble about the steamer, but if there is any
change of plan, Percy Randall can let his men know.
Since we have made up our minds, we had better not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
linger around here any more.” Then, turning to
Percy, he added: “Pick out fifty or sixty of the
strongest fellows and have them on hand at eleven
o’clock sharp.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Randall, “and now, fellows,
those of you that don’t happen to be chosen must not
be disappointed. You can all see that this is the best
plan, and that a large mob would spoil it. If you lie
awake to-night you’ll probably see some fun when we
get back.”</p>

<p>“Come now, fellows, let us disperse,” said Ray.
“There is nothing to be gained by standing around
here any longer. We will only betray our plans.”</p>

<p>At this the crowd quickly broke up, and the campus
soon resumed its usual aspect—with that one marked
exception—the absence of the old cannons, a change
more noticeable than ever now that the throng had dispersed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had better satisfy ourselves at once
about the boat,” said Edwards. “Suppose we go
down to see old Jerry?”</p>

<p>Accordingly Ray, Tony, Dick, and I accompanied
Edwards down to the small shanty in which Jerry
Bunce lived, situated on the shore of the lake, some
distance from the boat house dock.</p>

<p>Jerry Bunce was at home, but at first, to our consternation,
would not listen to our proposition.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a goin’ to hev no wild crowd o’ students a
playin’ the mischief with my boat,” he said emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>It required considerable argument to convince him
that we would do the boat no harm. He feared all
manner of trouble from the expedition, and raised
objection after objection. Edwards, however, had set
his mind on having the boat, and he had a persuasive
and convincing manner that eventually overcame old
Jerry’s opposition.</p>

<p>“Wall, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said at length.
“If ye must hev the boat to-night, and you’ll do it no
harm, I’ll let it to ye fer fifty dollars—not a cent
less.”</p>

<p>We closed with him gladly at this figure, and the
bargain was soon completed. The steamer was to be
ready at the place arranged that night at eleven o’clock.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>A NIGHT EXPEDITION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hist! Look out for the fence!”</p>

<p>It was Tony Larcom’s whispered exclamation of
warning to Ray Wendell, Dick Palmer, and myself.
We were hurrying along the narrow country lane that
skirted Packer’s woods, and Tony, who was leading,
had almost come to grief against the bars which
separated us from the broad meadow. The starlight
was all we had to guide us, the crescent moon having
set two hours before. Vaulting the fence, we turned
to the left and pursued our way through the somber
shadow of the woods, making a short straight cut to
the bank of the river. When within about twenty
yards of the water, we came out upon a stretch of
clear, open ground. There we stood a moment, straining
our eyes to catch a glimpse of the excursion boat
Geraldine. Just then the sound of the college clock
broke on the still night air. It was on the stroke of
eleven.</p>

<p>“We are prompt,” said Ray softly. “Now where
is the boat? Try the signal, Tony. I think I see a
shadow over there to the right.”</p>

<p>Tony picked up a stone and threw it well out into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the river toward a large black body that loomed up in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>Immediately a lantern appeared, and swung to and
fro. Then came the sound of oarlocks, and presently
a small rowboat approached the shore. We were taken
aboard, and in a few moments stood upon the deck of
the Geraldine.</p>

<p>Clinton Edwards was already there, having boarded
Jerry Bunce’s craft down at the lake. We had
scarcely been disposed of when there came another
signal—the splash of a stone beside the boat—and
the two men who had brought us turned again toward
the shore. And now the signals came fast and thick,
and the oarsmen were kept busy for the next ten
minutes transporting the students to the steamer. As
the first batch of them clambered up on deck, I was
surprised to see that they all wore masks.</p>

<p>“Why, what is all this disguise for?” I asked of
the nearest student.</p>

<p>His stalwart figure and strong voice easily betrayed
him. It was Percy Randall.</p>

<p>“I ordered the fellows to have masks. There will
be fun later, and we will need them. Better take
one,” and he held one toward me.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered sharply, “and moreover, I think——”
but I was interrupted by the sudden departure
of Randall to another part of the boat.</p>

<p>There was no catching him again at that moment
of confusion, and among the rapidly increasing crowd
of students similarly disguised. I was uneasy at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
spirit in which the enterprise was undertaken. I
moved forward to the front of the boat, where I found
Ray and Tony seated together, and some distance
from any of the others. I joined them immediately.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Harry,” said Ray. “I was just saying to
Tony that I don’t like the looks of things at all. We
have begun all wrong.”</p>

<p>“So say I,” was my prompt response. “These
masks don’t suit me. The fellows know that the college
has made strict laws against the wearing of masks.
What is it for?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” responded Ray. “We
have no need of them. I am sure we have no fear of
the Park men, nor any need to conceal our features
from them, while we certainly have no reason to be
ashamed to show ourselves when we return home
with the cannons. I can’t understand such concealment.
It seems underhand and sneaky.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose it is some of Percy Randall’s doings,”
said I. “He told me that he had ordered the
masks.”</p>

<p>At this moment Clinton Edwards came up. Ray
rose impatiently.</p>

<p>“Edwards, what on earth are these masks made
for?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Clinton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I have just been urging Percy
Randall to give them up, but he wouldn’t listen to
me, and the fellows all stand by him. They are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of his spirit of mischief. He is the leader and we
are simply nobodies.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said Ray. “I had my doubts when
you told Percy to organize. This is no Freshmen’s
scrape. This is to regain college rights—to vindicate
college honor, and it was only on that basis that I
joined it. Percy Randall is too reckless and mischief
loving to run such an enterprise.”</p>

<p>Edwards laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t unseat him now. The fellows are
all in his wake. After all, maybe I exaggerated. He
promised good behavior, and I don’t think he intends
any wild capers. Our best plan is to join the rest and
use our influence in keeping them closely to the night’s
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t back out now,” said Ray, leaning
on the rail and looking down at the water that spurted
upward in front of the prow as the boat made rapid
headway toward Berkeley. “We will have to see it
through, and perhaps it may turn out all right, though
I don’t feel at all at ease. Your plan is undoubtedly
the wisest, so let us make the best of it.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation dropped, and except for a
few occasional remarks in low tones, the remainder
of the trip was made in silence. After the first twenty
minutes all the students moved forward to the front
of the boat, where they stood in silent expectation of
the sight of Park Hill, where the slumbering college
lay.</p>

<p>It was a curious group that huddled there at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
bow of the Geraldine, mysteriously masked, and bearing
an air of grim determination that boded no good
for any unfortunate Park College man that happened
to be abroad at that hour of the night.</p>

<p>Suddenly we shot out from the shadow of the trees
that darkened the bank of the river at that point,
and came upon a stretch of open land rising gently
to a plateau on which the college rested. In some respects
the situation of Park College was not unlike
our own, although Belmont had more shade, stood on
higher ground, and close to a lake of considerable
size, while Berkeley had no water beyond the narrow
river. There was a dock somewhat similar to ours,
though smaller, which jutted out into the stream, and
toward this we faced. The bell sounded faintly from
the engine room, the wheels ceased their beating, and
we glided gently through the smooth water that rippled
softly away from our bow. Slower and slower
we moved until we had almost reached the dock,
when one of our men dropped quietly over, with a
rope on his arm. Then came a gentle bump as the
boat grated against the dock, a quick knotting of the
hawser, a slight straining and creaking of timbers,
and the first step in our expedition was taken. We
had “crossed the Rubicon.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>A STARTLING DÉNOUEMENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now then, Jerry,” said Clinton Edwards to old
Captain Bunce, “you and your men stay quietly here
and watch for us. Be ready to put off quickly, for we
shall have no time to spare when we return.”</p>

<p>Falling naturally into ranks of three and four
abreast, we moved cautiously up the rising land until
we reached the level of the college ground, and stood
in the shade of the trees at the outskirts of the rear
campus. There we halted a moment, while Percy
Randall gave the fellows a few whispered directions.</p>

<p>“What is your plan of action, Percy?” asked Edwards.</p>

<p>“To keep the rest here while four of us search the
grounds. The moment we discover the location of
the cannons we will return.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Edwards; “and who is to go ahead
to reconnoiter?”</p>

<p>“My idea was to have you, Ray Wendell, Harry
Elder, and perhaps Tony Larcom accompany me, but
you have no masks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” exclaimed Ray, “what has that to
do with it? We don’t need to hide our faces. Go
ahead; we’ll follow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” answered Percy; “don’t waste a minute,
then, but come on.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to the rest, he said in a louder whisper:</p>

<p>“Lie low, fellows, till we want you.”</p>

<p>All dropped flat upon the ground, where the high
grass hid them completely from view. Percy Randall
had them well in hand, and had evidently given
them minute instructions. Whatever might be said
of Percy, he was certainly in thorough command of
the situation, and his coolness and courage made him
a valuable leader for our party at this critical period
of our expedition.</p>

<p>Leading the rest, the five of us crept stealthily forward
under the shadow of the campus trees, looking
sharply to right and left for the least indication as to
the whereabouts of our old artillery pieces.</p>

<p>“It is more than likely that we will find them on
the front campus,” said Edwards, under his breath.
“It would be no triumph for the Park men unless
they display their spoils prominently.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ray; “and it is just like their
impudence to place the cannons in an exactly similar
spot to that which they occupied on our campus so
long.”</p>

<p>In accordance with this idea, we stole softly along
the paths and around the buildings toward the front
of the grounds.</p>

<p>In our progress we met no one. The campus and
buildings were dark and silent. Not a sound nor a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
ray of light betrayed the fact that the gloomy halls
about us were inhabited by slumbering inmates.
Trusting in the protection of the deeper shade of the
large elm trees in the front campus, we moved forward
more confidently.</p>

<p>Suddenly Percy Randall turned and grasped Ray
Wendell by the wrist.</p>

<p>“Well, well, what is it?” asked Ray in a startled
whisper, as the rest of us joined them.</p>

<p>“There, there! look there, by the gate!” exclaimed
Percy with a low chuckle of exultation. His exclamation
was not without good cause. Percy’s eyes
were sharp, and they had not served him in vain on
this occasion, for down by the gate, close together,
stood our dear old cannons, and looking so natural
in that position that we felt for a moment that we must
be upon our own campus. Perhaps an ordinary passer
by might not have noticed them on a night like this;
but our eyes, long grown accustomed to the shape of
the old carriages, quickly discerned them even in the
dark shadows of the elm trees.</p>

<p>Forgetting everything but our discovery, we hastened
forward, and in silent delight clasped the old
iron cylinders in our arms.</p>

<p>“Now for the other fellows!” exclaimed Percy
Randall. “You wait here till I come back with the
rest.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the bell up in the tower of the
main building struck one single note, that rolled and
echoed over the campus with startling emphasis. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
was one o’clock. Suppressing our excitement, we
stretched ourselves out beside the cannons and awaited
Percy’s return in absolute silence.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged along wearily, and the stillness
was growing almost burdensome, when we heard
numerous stealthy footsteps behind us; and rising up,
we found ourselves surrounded by Percy Randall and
his masked followers. Even to us, who knew them
to be our companions, this sudden appearance of a
band of disguised men, creeping towards the cannons
in the dim starlight, had a strikingly weird and fantastic
effect. Had Percy Randall been enacting some
dire melodrama, he could not have prepared his materials
or set his scene better.</p>

<p>“Now then, quick with the ropes!” said Percy, as
the fellows gathered about. At that moment, Tony
Larcom, who had been investigating the wheels, gave
a groan.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! they are chained!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Chained?” cried Percy.</p>

<p>“Yes. The right wheel of this cannon is chained
to one gate, and the right wheel of the other cannon
is fast to the other gate.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Ray Wendell. “They are
chained and padlocked. That is bad, for the gates
are iron, and make mighty solid anchors.”</p>

<p>There was a silence for a moment. Our hearts
began to sink.</p>

<p>“Can’t we file the chains?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tony. “It would take too long, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
we can’t stay here even ten minutes without running
great risk of being caught.”</p>

<p>“Let us take the gates too, then,” exclaimed Percy
Randall in his impetuous way.</p>

<p>This remark struck none of us seriously until Ray
Wendell, who had been examining the hinges, replied:</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea at all. The gates merely rest on
their hinges. Two or three of us could slip one off.
Lend a hand here, and let us try.”</p>

<p>Two fellows sprang forward and put their shoulders
to the gate. Ray had judged correctly, for, to our
surprise and delight, the gate rose slowly off its hinges,
and in a moment was resting beside the cannon.</p>

<p>“Good, good!” cried Percy Randall softly. “Now
take the other off, and we will bind each on the back
of the cannon to which it is chained.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is rich!” said Tony Larcom to me with
a chuckle. “I can’t help admiring Percy’s nerve. If
the rest of the college had been fast to the gates, I
believe he would have proposed taking it in tow.”</p>

<p>We lost no time in getting our ropes attached to the
cannons, and in swinging the muzzles around. Then,
stretching out the ropes in the form of two long loops,
we divided our party into two sections, one for each
cannon. This done, we lined up and took our places.
Percy Randall gave the signal for one section, and
Ray Wendell for the other. The two columns swayed
forward, the ropes became tight and rigid, and then
off we moved slowly, pulling our old cannons after us.</p>

<p>Throughout our movements we had thus far been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
undisturbed. Park College being situated some little
distance out of Berkeley, we had no fear of alarm
from town folks, and only anticipated the possibility
of some one awaking in the college buildings. We
had been very quiet in our actions, but, in dragging
the cannons, some noise could not be avoided. It was,
therefore, a period of terrible suspense, while we
tugged frantically at the old pieces, fearing every moment
that a note of alarm would be sounded.</p>

<p>We had passed all the buildings in safety with one
exception—a dormitory that stood somewhat apart
from the rest, and directly in the line of our path
toward the river. We approached along the gravel
walk with the greatest caution, moving very slowly
while in front of the building, that we might avoid
all chance of being detected. We were getting along
toward the end of the dormitory, and were beginning
to breathe freer, when we struck upon a short stretch
of flag pavement that led to the entrance at that end
of the building. The rattle of the wheels on those
stones struck a chill to our hearts—a chill, however,
which was nothing to the cold shiver we experienced
a moment later, when we heard the sound of some
one moving in a bedroom on the ground floor, and a
short, quick cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there! who is that?”</p>

<p>The voice sounded just beside us. It came from a
white robed figure standing in a window immediately
to the right of the entrance.</p>

<p>He seemed for a moment unable to comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the situation, and stood staring wildly out through the
grating that protected the first story windows. Then,
as his wits returned to him, he sprang hastily toward
his door, evidently to give a general cry of alarm.
Had he remained within his room and contented himself
with shouting, he might have utterly destroyed
our plans, but in opening his door he placed himself
at our mercy. This was just such an emergency as
Percy Randall loved. Quick as a flash he turned,
and, crying to the nearest man, “Help me shut this
fellow up!” he dashed into the entry, followed by
his companion. They met the bewildered student just
as he opened the door. There was a short, sharp
struggle while Percy and his companion bound him
tightly; then he lay perfectly still.</p>

<p>“There, that nips his little game in the bud,” said
Percy. “Now what shall we do with him? Take
him along, too?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered his companion, who proved to be
Ray Wendell. “Put him in on his bed and leave him.
We must hurry.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the two lifted the student into his
room, and, after making sure that the gag was arranged
to give him no pain, they left him and we
were off again.</p>

<p>We were now safe outside of the college grounds,
and so, unmindful of the noise of the wheels and the
clanking of the gates, we pulled furiously toward the
river, where we could see the Geraldine awaiting us.</p>

<p>As we struck the downward grade the ropes slackened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
in our hands, and, instead of our pulling, the
cannons gathered speed and began to press us hard.
It was too late to stop them, so down the grade we
scrambled in confused ranks, straining every nerve
to avoid our old iron pursuers, who came bumping
along behind us until they struck the soft earth just
before the dock, where they buried their muzzles in
the ground.</p>

<p>Then, laughing at the situation, we gathered about
them, pulled them out, and dragged them down the
pier, with a great rumble and roar of the heavy wheels
upon the echoing timbers.</p>

<p>As we looked backward with relief at the college
buildings, now far behind us, we wondered if the dull
thunder of our cannon wheels broke in upon the
dreams of any of the sleepers there, and if they had
any appreciation of the true significance of the sound.</p>

<p>A few minutes sufficed to roll the cannons aboard
the Geraldine, and then, without more delay, we turned
toward Belmont. The object of our trip had been
accomplished. Our delight knew no bounds. Percy
Randall was for giving three rousing cheers, but Ray
Wendell repressed him.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Don’t disturb their rest. Let
their surprise be complete when they get up to-morrow
morning and find cannons and gates gone.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me. What shall we do with those
gates?” asked Percy.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” exclaimed Edwards with a laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
“it was your suggestion to bring them, and so they
are yours.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully,” said Percy, “but I don’t want
them. Let us file the chains or break the padlocks,
and throw the gates overboard.”</p>

<p>“There you go again, Percy,” said Edwards.
“Don’t you see that that would put us in the wrong
at once? We want to hold the gates subject to return
so as to show that we didn’t come to steal anything.
Loosen them from the cannons, that is the first
thing. Then for the time being we can leave them
down at our boathouse. When Park College wants
them back we can return them.”</p>

<p>Percy and several others went below to work over
the cannons, while the rest of us remained on the
upper deck during the trip home. By the time we
had reached the lake and were making toward our
dock, the gates had been loosened, and the cannons
considerably lightened by their freedom from these
encumbrances, stood ready for their old positions.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after the gates had been placed by
the boathouse, the fellows manned the ropes and
started off briskly with the cannons. As we left the
pier the rope on which I was pulling snapped close by
the carriage. A halt was called to repair the break.
Ray Wendell drew out his match-box—a handsome
silver case which he always carried with him—and
lit a match, while I crept under the carriage and refastened
the rope. Then we started on again, Ray
pulling on the same rope with me, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
in front of me. When we had got about half way up
the hill from the lake the fellow who was just behind
me leaned forward and whispered:</p>

<p>“Will you ask Wendell for his match safe, please?”</p>

<p>I immediately touched Ray on the arm.</p>

<p>“Let me have your match safe, will you, Ray?”</p>

<p>He handed it to me at once, and I passed it back
to the fellow behind, who, being masked like the
others, was unrecognized by me.</p>

<p>“When you are done, give it back to Ray Wendell,”
I said.</p>

<p>After a few moments more of hard pulling we
reached our campus, and with a tingling sense of
pleasure at the final accomplishment of our plans,
hurried the cannons along to their old resting place.</p>

<p>“And now, fellows,” said Edwards, “we must give
three cheers before we disperse. Why don’t you take
off your masks? Don’t you know that you run unnecessary
risks by wearing them?”</p>

<p>Percy Randall and another student were busy at
the touch holes of the cannons. Percy looked up.</p>

<p>“Hold on, fellows; the fun hasn’t more than begun,”
he cried.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ray Wendell in
wonderment.</p>

<p>Percy stood up and scratched a match.</p>

<p>“I propose a volley of cheers for our successful
campaign,” he cried.</p>

<p>I started to cheer, but I found my voice drowned
out in a deafening blare of tin horns which every man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
drew from his pocket. This was a totally unexpected
development, for a horn spree was the last thing I
anticipated at that time. Still we were in for it now,
and I was disposed to enjoy the fun while it lasted.
Before my ears had become accustomed to the hideous
twang of the horns another shock occurred.</p>

<p>Percy Randall leaned forward with his match.
There was a sharp sputtering for a few seconds,
then two vivid, blinding sheets of flame, and the double
roar of the two cannons, which at some time during
the trip home on the Geraldine had been loaded by
Percy’s directions. It was the first time in many years
that the voice of the old artillery had been heard,
but it seemed as if all the force reserved during that
long spell of silence was concentrated in this one blast,
for the ground under us fairly shook, while we could
hear windows rattling and crashing in every direction.</p>

<p>Immediately everybody took to his heels, and as
the roar of the cannons rolled away, the sharp nasal
bray of horns reëchoed from every quarter of the
campus, dying away in the recesses of the various
buildings whither the crowd had taken flight. It was
“every man for himself” in that scramble, and for
my part, the shortest route to my room in Colver Hall
was what suited me best, so off I dashed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to pass near the college offices.
I thought I was in safety, and was about to pass my
entry when a rough hand was laid on my collar. I
was brought to a sudden and unexpected stop, the
shock of which nearly jerked my head off. I struggled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to free myself, but in vain, so, turning about to
see who my captor was, I discovered to my dismay
that I was standing face to face with proctor Murray.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<small>A PRISONER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The fatal power and tenacity of proctor Murray’s
grasp was known to every student of Belmont College,
if not by personal experience, at least by reputation.
From the moment I discovered that it was his
hand upon my shoulder, I realized that further resistance
would be worse than useless, so I stood perfectly
still, and endeavored to accept the situation
calmly. Still holding me firmly with one hand, he
coolly scratched a match with the other, held it close
to my face for an instant, and then extinguished it.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Mr. Elder?” he said. “This
is the first time I ever caught you in a scrape.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan,” I answered, “and no one regrets it
more than I do. If I could have had only fifteen
seconds’ more start, I’ll venture to say you never would
have caught me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” he said, with a short laugh, “but
here you are all the same. You’re a Junior, Mr. Elder.
That’s pretty late in your college life to be out
on a spree.”</p>

<p>“I own that, Dan, and the worst of it is that I
never knew there was going to be any mischief until
I found myself in the midst of it——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose not,” said Murray, with slight sarcasm.
“It has been my experience always to catch
the innocent men. It was always the <em>rest</em> that were
to blame. Now, since you had nothing to do with
this little trouble I suppose you wouldn’t mind telling
me who were the chief parties concerned, before I
let you go.”</p>

<p>I knew that he was joking, but I could not help a
slight sense of resentment at this proposition.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Dan,” I replied, “you don’t suppose
that you are going to get any such information as that
from me, do you? You don’t suppose that I am going
to betray the others——”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you were one of them?” said Dan, still
enjoying his little joke. “I supposed from what you
said that you were only a spectator, and, somehow, got
mixed up in the trouble.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to stand my share of the responsibility,”
I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Elder, I’m sorry you got caught.
There are many worse young men in college than
you, and I wish I had caught one of them instead,
but as it is, I am afraid you’ll have to stand the racket.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dan,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything unless the faculty ask me
to report, but I know they will, for there have been
a good many college laws broken to-night—and a
good many college windows, too, if I’m not mistaken.
It’s pretty serious trouble all around, and I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
think there’s any doubt but what the faculty will need
you at their meeting to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then; I suppose I’ll have to oblige
them,” I answered soberly, as I thought of the possible
results of that meeting.</p>

<p>“You can go now, Mr. Elder. I hope you’ll get
off easy,” added Murray, as he took his hand from
my shoulder and walked away.</p>

<p>I started for my room, but before I had taken three
steps an idea occurred to me.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Dan!” I called after Murray’s receding
figure. He stopped.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Mr. Elder?”</p>

<p>“When you are asked to report to-morrow, would
you mind saying in my favor that I wore no mask?”</p>

<p>“Hullo! So the rest wore masks, did they?” exclaimed
Murray gruffly. “That won’t help matters
any.”</p>

<p>I saw the fatal mistake I had made, and I could
have bitten my tongue off for speaking. I was so out
of patience with myself that I turned abruptly and
dashed up stairs to my room, where I threw myself
on my sofa and brooded for half an hour in mortified
silence.</p>

<p>It seemed, then, that Dan Murray had not known
that the other fellows wore masks. It was probable
that he did not arrive on the scene till quite late, and
was unable to scrutinize any one closely except myself.
Of course if I had kept silent the fact that
masks were used would not have been known, but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
now that I had betrayed it, the affair immediately took
on a far more serious aspect.</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” I thought bitterly, “and yet how
could I help it? It never occurred to me that Dan
had not noticed the masks.”</p>

<p>One consideration alone arose to console me in my
self recrimination, and that was rather a poor sort
of consolation.</p>

<p>“After all,” I said, “since I am the only one caught
to-night, none suffers by it except myself. I only
made matters worse for myself by saying anything
about the masks.”</p>

<p>Concerning the nature of the results of the night’s
adventures I could only surmise; but now that the excitement
was over and I could look at the matter soberly,
I felt grave doubts arising in my mind. The spirit
in which most of the fellows had acted had been one
of open defiance of college laws, so I had no reason
to doubt that the faculty would view the affair very
seriously. Wearing masks and blowing horns had always
been regarded as an indication of the most disorderly
spirit, and had usually been met by the severest
penalties, in the form of suspension from college for
some time, and in one or two cases outright expulsion.
My uneasiness rapidly increased as my mind dwelt on
the possible fate awaiting me.</p>

<p>“It’s all Percy Randall’s fault,” I exclaimed impatiently.
“Confound him and his mischievous
pranks! If we had gone quietly to our rooms after
setting the cannons in place, or had contented ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
with three cheers, all would have been well.
As it is now, I don’t know what is to become of me.”</p>

<p>I passed an anxious and almost sleepless night on
the sofa where I had flung myself when I entered.
As the hours dragged slowly along, the condition of
my nerves scarcely improved, and by the time the
first gray streaks of dawn appeared, I had worried
myself into a state bordering on distraction. My
bones were aching from insufficient rest, and my head
was burning and feverish.</p>

<p>I rose about seven o’clock, and, bathing my face,
redressed myself, and waited impatiently for the breakfast
hour. I was anxious to get away from myself,
to find something to do or some one to talk to—anything
but the long, lonely silence of the past few hours.
I left my room as soon as I heard the first signs of
life about the building, and went over to my eating
club. On the way I noticed that nearly every window
on the first floor of Burke and Colver Halls had been
shattered by the cannons the night before—a fact
that scarcely contributed to lessen my anxiety.</p>

<p>To my great relief I found Tony Larcom before
me at the club. Tony looked as if he had slept scarcely
more than I, but he was bright and cheerful as usual.
He looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>“See here, Harry,” said he, “you don’t want to
carry around such a guilty face as that to-day. You’ll
be arrested on suspicion.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late now,” I answered, “because I’ve already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
been caught. I fell into Dan Murray’s clutches
last night.”</p>

<p>Instantly Tony was all concern.</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder, Harry, that’s too bad!” he exclaimed,
putting his hand on my shoulder. “Really,
I’m awfully sorry about that. I heard a rumor that
somebody had been caught, but I thought it was surely
one of Percy Randall’s select band—and it would
have served them right, too; but to think that <em>you</em>
got caught. Oh, that was hard luck.”</p>

<p>I thought so myself, but to hear some one else say
so did me good, and Tony’s sympathy was so genuine
that my spirits improved somewhat under it.</p>

<p>I determined to say nothing about my capture to
any one else, knowing well that it would become
known quickly enough when the faculty took action
in the matter. Whatever action they contemplated, I
received no advice concerning it during the morning
or early afternoon, and the day was, therefore, a
period of uneasy suspense to me. Without Tony Larcom
and his unfailing good humor for companionship
I do not know what I would have done. I never
appreciated his friendship so much as then.</p>

<p>All doubt was dispelled from my mind when, at
the close of the afternoon recitation, Mr. Dikes, who
stood just by the door as my classmates filed out,
touched me on the shoulder, and beckoned me to one
side.</p>

<p>“The faculty wish to see you at their meeting in
the main college office, Mr. Elder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Dikes,” I answered with all the
calmness I could summon. “I am ready.”</p>

<p>“If you will step into my office,” he said, “I will
let you know when they want you.”</p>

<p>As I started after Mr. Dikes, I felt some one touch
me. It was Tony Larcom.</p>

<p>“I wish you good luck, old fellow,” he said, hastily
pressing my arm. “Keep up your spirits, and don’t
let them rattle you.”</p>

<p>I nodded my thanks, and followed Mr. Dikes into
his office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>BEFORE THE FACULTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was not kept waiting long. Scarcely five minutes
had passed when the door again opened, and
Mr. Dikes reappeared.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr. Elder,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>With considerable trepidation I followed him, and
in a few seconds more I stood in the presence of the
faculty.</p>

<p>There was an ominous hush as I took my stand in
the middle of the room, facing the seven professors
who sat opposite me in a row. I looked apprehensively
from one to another with a view to ascertaining
what was to be the nature of my reception. My
glance was not encouraging. Severity was the predominant
expression on every countenance. In the
center, behind a small table, sat Dr. Drayton, the college
president. He was a man habitually sober and
impressive in manner, and, at this moment, his face
was exceptionally grave. Gazing at me sharply over
his glasses, he began:</p>

<p>“Mr. Elder, there was a riot among the students
last night, which resulted, as you know, in the destruction
of college property. It was conducted in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
spirit of open revolt against our laws. Horns were
blown, and the old cannons on the front campus were
loaded and discharged, breaking a number of windows.
Such culpable infringement of our rules has
not been known in some time past, and we are determined
to sift the matter to the bottom, and punish
the offenders to the fullest extent of our laws. Proctor
Murray reports that you were one of these offenders.
Have you anything to say?”</p>

<p>My voice trembled somewhat as I answered:</p>

<p>“I was among the students on the campus last
night.”</p>

<p>“Proctor Murray reports that masks were worn.
Is this true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“He also said you were an exception to this—that
while the rest wore masks, you had none.”</p>

<p>“I had no mask, sir. Knowing it to be against
college laws, I refused to wear a mask.”</p>

<p>“We are glad to know this in your favor, Mr.
Elder. The charge against you, however, is serious
enough. You were one of this disorderly crowd,
and you were associated with all its doings last
night.”</p>

<p>“I was with them, sir,” I answered.</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment, while Dr. Drayton
said something in a low tone to Mr. Dikes. The
latter left the room for a few seconds. On returning,
he made an affirmative sign to Dr. Drayton, and
stood by the door as if awaiting directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Show him in,” said Dr. Drayton.</p>

<p>I turned in surprise as the door again opened.
Could it be that some one else had been caught? I
could not avoid a slight sense of relief at the thought,
for I was becoming terribly depressed in my endeavor
to support alone the whole weight of professional dignity
arrayed against me. The thought of companionship
was extremely welcome to me.</p>

<p>I was not kept long in doubt. I heard Mr. Dikes’
voice say, “This way, please.” A quick, firm step
sounded in the outer office, the door was thrown wide
open, and <em>Ray Wendell</em> stood on the threshold.
There was a mutual expression of surprised recognition
between us, as he moved forward and stood beside
me. Dr. Drayton’s tone was even more severe
in addressing Ray than it had been to me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell,” he said, “you are here to answer a
charge of a very grave character. You are charged
with taking an active part in the disorderly disturbances
last night.”</p>

<p>Ray was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>“And may I ask, sir, on what ground that charge
is brought against me?”</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton held up a small silver object which had
been resting on his table, and which had escaped my
notice.</p>

<p>“This is your match box, I believe,” said the president.
“Your name is upon it.”</p>

<p>Ray started as he recognized the box, but recovered
himself almost immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It is my match box,” he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“It is, no doubt, from this box that the matches
were taken to light the cannons last night,” continued
Dr. Drayton, looking Ray steadily in the face.</p>

<p>Ray said nothing.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Mr. Wendell,” said Dr. Drayton after
a pause. “Were you one of that party of students
who created the disorder last night?”</p>

<p>“I was with them, sir,” said Ray, making the same
answer as I had.</p>

<p>“And you were masked like the others?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton looked at him quickly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell,” he said, in a still sharper tone of
voice, “we are speaking upon information furnished
us by Mr. Elder.”</p>

<p>Ray turned with a quick movement and looked at
me. I shall never forget that look—a look of
mingled surprise, disappointment, and reproach. It
cut me like a knife, for I saw only too clearly what it
meant. Coupling the display of the match box, which
he remembered giving me the night before, with Dr.
Drayton’s last words, Ray had concluded, as was only
natural in the face of such evidence, that I had betrayed
him. The thought that he should suspect me
of such baseness, for one instant, was more than I
could stand, so I hastened to correct the impression
at once.</p>

<p>“Dr. Drayton,” I said quickly, “my words misled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
you. When I said that I wore no mask I did not intend
to imply that <em>all</em> the rest wore masks.”</p>

<p>“That was certainly the impression you gave me,
sir,” answered Dr. Drayton, “and I think the other
gentlemen of the faculty placed a similar construction
upon your language.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, sir,” I stammered. “There
were several others besides myself who wore no
masks, and Mr. Wendell was one of them.”</p>

<p>I glanced quickly at Ray as I said this, in order
to mark the effect of my words. He would not look
at me, and it was only too evident from his manner
that his doubts had not been cleared by my attempted
explanation. Dr. Drayton’s positive tone, and my
hesitancy and embarrassment, Ray had undoubtedly
interpreted to my disadvantage. It must have seemed
to him that Dr. Drayton was right, and that I had
weakly shifted my position. I was distressed to see
that I had not improved matters appreciably.</p>

<p>“I must wait till we are alone; then I can explain
it,” I thought. Meanwhile I was in a far from enviable
position—in disgrace with the faculty, and
at the same time suspected of falseness by my best
friend.</p>

<p>The inquiries were again directed toward Ray.</p>

<p>“Then you <em>did not</em> wear a mask?” said Dr. Drayton.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Was the match box in your possession when the
cannons were discharged?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Ray. “I lent it to some one
a short time before.”</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton leaned forward and continued with
greater earnestness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell, this match box was found this morning
just beside one of the cannons. It was open, and
the matches were scattered about, as if it had been
dropped in haste immediately after the guns were discharged.
We are confident that the man who lighted
the cannons, held this match box in his hand.”</p>

<p>Ray was silent.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell, when was it that you lent the box?”
asked Professor Fuller, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>“About fifteen minutes before, while we were coming
up the hill from the lake,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“To whom did you lend it?” asked Dr. Drayton
quickly.</p>

<p>It was not a fair question, and Ray made no immediate
reply. He saw that a full and accurate answer
would turn upon me the suspicion of having lighted
the cannons. It was an excellent opportunity, had
he been disposed to accept it, for him to retaliate upon
me for my supposed falseness to him. But this, I
knew, was the kind of retaliation which Ray Wendell
despised. However much he may have doubted me
at that moment, it could in no way affect his own sense
of honor.</p>

<p>In answering, he measured his words carefully.</p>

<p>“It was dark, sir—too dark to recognize anybody,
except close by. Some one behind me asked for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
match box—I did not see him, but handed it back
without turning around.”</p>

<p>“But you recognized his voice, did you not?” questioned
Dr. Drayton, pushing the inquiry eagerly.</p>

<p>Ray hesitated.</p>

<p>“Dr. Drayton,” he said at length, “granted that I
knew who it was, could I be expected to tell—to——”</p>

<p>I could stand it no longer, so I broke in again.</p>

<p>“It was to <em>me</em>, sir, that Mr. Wendell gave his
match box.”</p>

<p>All, Ray included, looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>“To you!” exclaimed Dr. Drayton.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I answered, “to me, but only to pass it
back. Some one of those behind me asked for the
box, and I got it from Mr. Wendell. I only retained
it for a moment, and I do not know to whom I gave
it, for the rest were masked.”</p>

<p>Ray was looking at me with an expression of relief
on his face. He was beginning to see that he had misunderstood
the position of affairs.</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton was plainly disappointed. He had at
first thought that his inquiries had unearthed the chief
offender, but now he found himself as far astray as at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Scanning us both sharply he asked:</p>

<p>“Had either of you gentlemen any idea of the purpose
for which that match box was wanted?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” we answered together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“But you knew the cannons were to be discharged?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Ray, “not even that. It was
a total surprise to us. We had no idea that masks
were to be worn either.”</p>

<p>The professor looked at us incredulously.</p>

<p>“Then how came you to be identified with this
party, Mr. Wendell?” asked Professor Fuller. “How
is it that you, a prominent member of the Senior class,
became associated with this masked company?”</p>

<p>“The object of our gathering last night,” said Ray,
“was to regain the cannons which had been stolen
by the Park College men. It was on that basis alone
that I joined the party. I had no idea that there were
any mischievous intentions until too late to withdraw.”</p>

<p>“Please recount to us what occurred, Mr. Wendell,”
said Dr. Drayton.</p>

<p>Ray accordingly narrated the doings of the night
before, while the professors listened with eager interest.
When he had finished, Dr. Drayton said:</p>

<p>“I believe we have now all the facts before us, as
far as they can be ascertained; and, while they do not
by any means exculpate you, they throw a somewhat
more favorable light upon your motives. You had no
right, however, to take the law in your own hands,
as you did in this undertaking, and you cannot free
yourself from a share of the responsibility for what
occurred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“But the cannons, sir,” urged Ray. “They were
ours, and they had been stolen from us.”</p>

<p>“The cannons belong to the college,” said Dr.
Drayton severely, “and the college authorities were
the proper persons to take steps in the matter. We
had already begun action for their recovery when this
disorderly demonstration took place.”</p>

<p>Ray had nothing more to say.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, you may go now,” continued
the president. “You will please present yourselves
at my house this evening, when I will acquaint you
with the action of the faculty in this matter.”</p>

<p>We bowed, and were shown out of the room by Mr.
Dikes.</p>

<small>THE PENALTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>No sooner were we outside than Ray turned to me
and laid his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Harry, for doubting you a single
moment,” he said.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I answered; “I don’t wonder at your
doubts, for appearances were dead against me.”</p>

<p>“What was I to think?” he continued. “The only
evidence for summoning me was the match box which
I had given you. Then when Dr. Drayton spoke
about information obtained from you, what could I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it again,” I broke in. “It
disturbed me enough at the time to think that you
suspected me of such meanness. It is all right now,
so let it go.”</p>

<p>“I owe you a thousand apologies,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll give you a receipted bill of them, and
call it square,” I answered, laughing. “The question
that agitates me most just at this moment, is what
are the ‘potent, grave, and reverend signiors’ inside
there going to do with us.”</p>

<p>“I give it up,” answered Ray. “It is unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
all around. Here we are, the least offending in the
lot, hauled up to be made examples of, while scapegraces
like Percy Randall go at large, as if they were
spotless innocents. I could wring his neck for getting
us into this fix.”</p>

<p>“The faculty seem to be disposed to favor us somewhat,”
I said, as I recalled Dr. Drayton’s words.</p>

<p>Ray shook his head.</p>

<p>“We can’t get much encouragement, I fear, from
that. It only means that we won’t be expelled for
good, as we would have been, undoubtedly, if we had
been ringleaders.”</p>

<p>It was with anxious hearts that we awaited the
hour to go to Dr. Drayton’s house. I did not go to
dinner. I had no appetite, and I did not care to face
a club of noisy companions in my present mood.
About a quarter of eight o’clock Ray came to my
room, where I was pacing the floor impatiently, and
we went over to the president’s residence.</p>

<p>We were ushered into his study, where presently
Dr. Drayton joined us. Inviting us to be seated, in
his usual grave manner, he took his place at his desk,
which was situated in the middle of the room, and
began forthwith:</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, I may as well say at once that
I sincerely regret your connection with this unfortunate
affair. You are both young men of high
standing and good reputation in your separate classes,
and I am very sorry that anything should injure your
record. It seems quite evident to us that you were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
not ringleaders in the disorderly and mischievous behavior
of last night, and that you carried yourselves
as well as could be expected under the circumstances.
But you were concerned in these disgraceful doings;
you deliberately joined a party bent on taking the law
into its own hands and setting our authority at naught,
and you must therefore stand the consequences.”</p>

<p>Here Dr. Drayton paused a moment, while we
watched him in breathless suspense.</p>

<p>“As I told you this afternoon,” he continued, “we
had already taken steps for the recovery of the cannons,
and we were the proper ones to conduct the
affair. We were intensely annoyed at hearing of your
hasty behavior, for you have placed Belmont College
partially in the wrong by acting so forcibly. It was
hasty, injudicious, and disorderly, and even if you
had not aggravated it by a wanton spirit of mischievousness,
it would have been our duty to make an
example of you for taking authority into your own
hands. The faculty have given your case a full and
just consideration, and have come to the decision that
it will be necessary for us to suspend both of you from
college for a period of five weeks.”</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton paused again. His words had fallen
upon our attentive ears like a thunder clap. We dared
not look at each other. Each was busy with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>Five weeks’ suspension! Why, what would become
of us? There were only nine weeks in the last term
of the year, and the ninth week was occupied in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
final examinations. For Ray Wendell the affair was
likely to prove far more serious than for me. He
was in the Senior class, and therefore had his final
examinations two weeks earlier than I would. I
glanced at him quickly. His face was quiet but pale,
and I knew how he must be suffering, to see the fondest
hopes of his college life being swept away.</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton, who had been watching us closely,
began again:</p>

<p>“Young men, I can appreciate your thoughts at this
moment, and you are right in your estimate of the
serious results of this penalty upon your studies. In
your case particularly, Mr. Wendell, this suspension
would be almost fatal to your success in final examinations.
I speak, therefore, in behalf of the faculty in
offering you some remittance of this sentence.”</p>

<p>We both looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Upon a certain condition,” he added. “We saw
clearly that this punishment would interfere seriously
with the college work of both of you, and we were
glad, therefore, to consider the favorable circumstances
in your case, and to make every allowance possible
on account of your evident disposition to conduct yourselves
in an orderly manner last evening. Upon a certain
condition, therefore, we offer to remit a large part
of your punishment.”</p>

<p>We still gazed at him, anxiously expectant.</p>

<p>“You are both baseball players, and are devoting
a great deal of time to the game,” he said, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>We acquiesced silently.</p>

<p>“And you, I believe, Mr. Wendell, have accepted
the position of captain of the nine for this year.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Do you remember our conversation last spring,
Mr. Wendell? I warned you that baseball was taking
too much of your time. I found that you were
neglecting certain branches of study on account of
the game, and that it was interfering with your progress.
Did you forget that warning?”</p>

<p>“No, Dr. Drayton. I accepted your suggestions,
and, at first determined to give up baseball this year;
but my college mates begged me not to go back on
them, and upon thinking it over I made up my mind
that I could, by being careful, keep up baseball, and
lose nothing by it in my studies.”</p>

<p>“It is a mistaken idea altogether, sir,” exclaimed
Dr. Drayton with some show of impatience. “You
made an experiment of it last year, and what was
the result? You dropped five places in your class
during the baseball season. You, Mr. Elder, dropped
ten. I say it is useless to attempt it, and I am sorry
to see so promising young men throwing away opportunities
and wasting time on a mere game.”</p>

<p>“But, Dr. Drayton,” said Ray, “I can’t help thinking
that baseball does us as much good in one way
as our studies do in another.”</p>

<p>“All exercise is good—in moderation,” answered
Dr. Drayton sharply, “but when a game interferes
with your class work, then it is time to stop. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
matter was well gone over in our interview last year,
and I am sorry, Mr. Wendell, that my warning was
so little heeded. It comes now, however, to a choice.
The faculty is willing to make your penalty in this
case merely a nominal suspension of two weeks, upon
condition that you young men consent to give up baseball.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for several moments. At
length Dr. Drayton said,</p>

<p>“Well, young gentlemen, what is your choice?”</p>

<p>Ray rose.</p>

<p>“Why should we be put to the necessity of a choice,
Dr. Drayton? If I am careful, I see no reason why
baseball should conflict with my class work.”</p>

<p>“We are no longer to discuss the matter, Mr. Wendell.
You know my views well enough, and it would
be useless to repeat them. The question is merely
which of these will you choose. I am sure good sense
will relieve both of you of any hesitation in the matter.”</p>

<p>“But I have promised my fellow students to play
ball. The nine has already begun work. It would
break up all our plans,” exclaimed Ray.</p>

<p>“I cannot see the importance of your baseball
plans,” said the president coldly.</p>

<p>“I feel in honor bound to my college mates. I
cannot desert them,” answered Ray desperately.</p>

<p>“Dr. Drayton,” said I, “the season has so far advanced
that it would not be fair to the rest for us to
back out now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Then what am I to understand is your answer?”
asked Dr. Drayton, looking fixedly at us.</p>

<p>Ray turned to me. It was evident that we were
of the same mind. Ray’s thoughts no doubt dwelt
longingly a moment on the commencement honors he
had hoped to win, but his face showed no struggle,
no hesitation. Dr. Drayton’s effort to force him into
renouncing baseball had aroused all his latent pride
and sense of honor. He felt, as I did, that the condition
was unfair, and based upon a wrong assumption—namely,
that baseball and studies could not be conducted
together without a loss to the latter. Turning
to the president, Ray spoke for both of us.</p>

<p>“If this is the condition, Dr. Drayton, then we
must choose the five weeks’ suspension,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>Dr. Drayton wheeled sharply around in his chair
and took up some papers that lay on his desk. From
the way his hands trembled I could see that he was
very angry.</p>

<p>I started to speak.</p>

<p>“You have said quite enough, young gentlemen,”
he said in a constrained voice. “If this is your decision,
I must own that I am deeply disappointed at
your choice, which does you very little credit. Please
make arrangements to leave college to-morrow. Mr.
Dikes will notify your parents of your suspension.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Drayton, is there <em>no</em> alternative?” asked Ray
almost imploringly, his voice nearly breaking under
the pressure of his pent up feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“There <em>was</em> an alternative, sir, but you have rejected
it. Nothing now remains but the penalty which
the faculty have imposed. You would have shown
more wisdom had you accepted that alternative.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir; we cannot accept,” exclaimed Ray in
despair.</p>

<p>“Then good day, sir,” said Dr. Drayton, without
relaxing a muscle.</p>

<p>Recognizing the hopelessness of further words, we
turned and went out. As we walked down the long
gravel walk, Ray said slowly, as if talking to himself.</p>

<p>“It was a terribly high price to pay for a season of
baseball. I hope the boys will appreciate that if we
don’t win the Crimson Banner.”</p>

<p>“I can’t realize it yet,” I rejoined. “It seems too
terrible. Just think of it! Five weeks from the college!
We will have to live somewhere in town, and
go to the baseball grounds by a roundabout way, for
if we are caught on the campus during our suspension
we will be expelled——”</p>

<p>“Little difference it would make to me,” said Ray
bitterly. “I might just as well have been expelled
for all the chance it leaves me.”</p>

<p>“There, old fellow, don’t take it hard,” I exclaimed,
detecting in his voice the symptoms of breaking
down. “I know it puts you in a terrible fix, but,
somehow, it seems as if something <em>must</em> happen. I
can’t make up my mind that it is true. There must
be some way out of the hole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Ray shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“I see none. We have refused the only chance
offered us.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I exclaimed eagerly, after a moment’s
thought; “there is a chance left.”</p>

<p>“Where?” exclaimed Ray, looking at me eagerly.</p>

<p>“Professor Fuller,” I answered.</p>

<p>Ray was silent for a few seconds. Then his face
brightened a little.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said. “You are right. There is a
chance in him. We will go to see Professor Fuller
to-morrow.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>A VISIT TO PROFESSOR FULLER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Whatever may have been Ray Wendell’s feelings
that night, my own were varied and conflicting. Not
that I repented of our decision. By no means. If
the question had again been presented to us in the
manner in which it had been proposed by Dr. Drayton
the evening previous, I should have made the same
answer. But, at the same time, the importance of
our college duties, and their claim upon our attention,
made me regret more deeply the necessity that had
compelled such a choice as ours.</p>

<p>Frequently during the night would arise the question:
“Should I have sacrificed my college interests
for baseball?” and almost immediately would come
the feeling that we had been treated unjustly in
being forced to such a choice, and that we were right
in rejecting it. The more I considered the matter,
however, the more in doubt I became. From this
doubt Professor Fuller offered the only chance of
relief, and I maintained unwavering trust in him.</p>

<p>“I won’t get discouraged about the matter until I
hear what the ‘old governor’ has to say,” I repeated
to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>Professor Fuller was the oldest and by far the most
popular member of the faculty. He was always the
student’s first friend on his entrance into Belmont;
and many a homesick boy had cause to remember most
gratefully the kind attention of the professor at a
time when the surroundings were strange to him and
he was sadly in need of friendly advice. The old
gentleman had always made it a principle to interest
himself in all newcomers, to welcome them, and make
them feel at home. By innumerable little acts of
kindness he would manifest his fatherly interest in the
boys, who loved him one and all with a warmth of feeling
second only to that which they possessed for their
parents.</p>

<p>There was no student who had not at some time
felt the kindly influence of Professor Fuller, but it
was the boy in trouble who always had special cause
to be grateful. To him the students turned instinctively
when in need of guidance or advice, and no one
ever came away disappointed. It was this that had
won for him the title of “the old governor,” which
was no disrespectful name, but a genuine term of endearment,
and was used by the fellows with feelings of
the utmost affection.</p>

<p>It was no idle thought, therefore, that suggested
Professor Fuller’s name to me, nor a vain hope that
led us to seek his counsel in our trouble.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast the following morning
I sought out Ray Wendell that we might lose no
time in making our call on the professor. We met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
at the post office, and one glance at his face showed
me that Ray’s mind was scarcely more at ease than
my own. Few words were exchanged as we walked
along the shady lane at the left of the college grounds,
leading to Professor Fuller’s house. This was situated
quite a distance back from the gate, in the midst
of a large lawn, which was cut off from the street by
a high hedge of evergreens.</p>

<p>As we approached we heard just on the other side
of this hedge a female voice calling to Sport, the professor’s
large collie dog, who was burrowing under
the bushes. On entering the gate, we saw Miss Nettie
Fuller leaning forward over a bank of flowers.
She was a bright and attractive girl of sixteen and was
held in the highest regard by the students who were
fortunate enough to know her. Both of us being acquaintances
of long standing, we stopped to speak to
her. She did not notice us at first, for her face was
hidden by a large sunbonnet, and her attention was
engaged in her work, and in keeping the dog out of
mischief.</p>

<p>“Sport, Sport, come here and leave that poor squirrel
alone!” she called, turning her head toward the
hedge.</p>

<p>At this moment the squirrel broke cover, and rushed
across the path directly in front of us, Sport after it
in hot pursuit. Immediately we dashed for him.
Sport saw us coming, shied to one side, and brought
us all down in a heap on the gravel path, Ray, however,
retaining a firm hold on the dog’s collar. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
was a sharp scuffle, a yelp from Sport, and the three
of us rolled over and over in a confused mass.</p>

<p>Miss Nettie screamed faintly as she turned round;
then, taking in the situation, she burst into a peal of
laughter, while we disentangled ourselves, and got up.</p>

<p>“We were trying to make ourselves useful, Miss
Nettie,” said Ray, as he picked up his hat and dusted
off his clothes. “I hope we were, for we have ruined
our chances of being ornamental.”</p>

<p>Thinking that she had perhaps laughed too hard
at us, Miss Nettie blushed and sobered down.</p>

<p>“I hope you are not hurt,” she said. “Please excuse
my laughing so. I fear you think I am very
rude to receive visitors in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“Not when visitors call so informally,” returned
Ray, with a smile.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Miss Nettie had taken off
her sunbonnet, and was swinging it by the strings.
She evidently wished to say something, but was in
some doubt how to begin. Surmising what the subject
might be, I asked:</p>

<p>“Is Professor Fuller in, Miss Nettie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she answered, looking up quickly.
Then, continuing her gaze, she said slowly, “I think
I know what you want to see him for.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” answered Ray gravely. “The
whole town will know it by to-night.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how awfully sorry I am,” went on
Miss Nettie, with an accent of genuine sympathy.
“I heard all about it at breakfast this morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
I think you are having a great deal more trouble than
you deserve.”</p>

<p>We looked at her gratefully.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your fault if the other boys didn’t behave,”
she continued earnestly. “You did all you
could to keep them quiet, and it was very mean of
them to get you into such trouble.”</p>

<p>“The boys didn’t intend to, Miss Nettie,” I said,
laughing. Notwithstanding her injustice to the other
boys, I was pleased to have her take our part so
warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” she said emphatically. “They
should have done as you said.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I wish they had,” said Ray fervently.</p>

<p>“As for bringing back the cannons, I think you
ought to have the vote of thanks of the whole town
instead of being suspended as if you had done something
wrong. To think of your going away over to
Berkeley and taking the cannons right off their campus!
Oh, it was splendid! I got awfully excited
while father was telling me about it. If I had been a
boy I would have gone along too—and I told father
so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Miss Nettie,” said Ray.
“I only hope your father is as generous in his opinion
of us as you are.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettie looked at us with an expression of
significance.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” she said lowering her voice,
“I think father enjoyed the story as much as I did,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
and I believe he admires you for what you did. But
don’t let him know that I told you.”</p>

<p>We were considerably relieved to hear this.</p>

<p>“You will find father in the library, I think,” she
added. “Come in and I will see.”</p>

<p>The professor was seated at his table when we entered
the library, but he rose at once and greeted us
with his cordial smile, and a warm clasp of the hand.</p>

<p>“Good morning, boys,” he said. “I half expected
to see you this morning. Be seated.”</p>

<p>Miss Nettie here left us with her father, who resumed
his chair, while we sat down opposite him.
Then there was an awkward pause.</p>

<p>“Well, out with it,” said Professor Fuller at length.
“I can easily guess your errand.”</p>

<p>“We have come to see you about our suspension,”
said Ray. “We want your advice.”</p>

<p>“Why, what advice can I give you?” he asked.
“You have made your own decision. Doesn’t that
dispose of the matter?”</p>

<p>“We fear it does,” said Ray, “but we have come
to see if there is any hope for us under the circumstances.
Is there no possible chance of our obtaining
some remittance of this penalty?”</p>

<p>“A chance was offered you, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but the conditions imposed forced us
to decline that chance,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>Professor Fuller’s face was grave but kindly.</p>

<p>“And do you think,” he asked, “that baseball is
more important than your success in college?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, by no means,” answered Ray earnestly.
“Nor did we intend to give Dr. Drayton that impression.
While meaning no disrespect either to Dr. Drayton
or the faculty, we cannot help feeling that we
were placed in an unfair position. Our penalty was
five weeks’ suspension for taking part in the disturbances
of night before last. Now, if we deserved five
weeks why was it not assigned as our penalty without
further question? If we deserved two weeks, why
was not that assigned? But this baseball matter was
dragged in to influence the question. What has our
playing baseball to do with the question as to whether
our penalty for a misdemeanor shall be five or two
weeks? Playing baseball is not a misdemeanor. We
felt that our penalty should be assigned simply on
our behavior in this case, without being conditioned
upon outside matters that have nothing to do with it.
We feel that Dr. Drayton has taken advantage of our
helpless position to force us into giving up baseball.
Our parents do not object to our playing, and we do
not see why we should be compelled to make such a
choice as was offered us. This is what we think is
not fair.”</p>

<p>Ray had grown bolder as he continued, so that, by
the time he finished, I feared Professor Fuller would
be angry. The latter, however, was quite calm, and
listened quietly with folded hands.</p>

<p>When Ray ceased speaking he said:</p>

<p>“Of course, boys, you know that, however much
I may sympathize with you, I must speak, as a member<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
of the faculty. But I appreciate the whole weight
of what you say, and am sure that you believe that
you are doing what is right under the circumstances.
I can easily understand your making such a choice,
considering the manner in which the matter was presented
to you, and I do not wonder at your feelings
at the present moment. I will be frank enough to say
that the proposition was Dr. Drayton’s and that he
carried the matter through. The penalty that would
have been assigned under ordinary circumstances was
five weeks’ suspension. We took into consideration,
however, the many mitigating circumstances in your
case, and we were inclined to lessen the sentence
greatly. It was then that Dr. Drayton bethought him
of this condition. I will not say anything about the
matter further than that it was Dr. Drayton’s action
entirely. As he was earnestly bent upon your accepting
this condition, I can easily understand why
your choice should have annoyed him.”</p>

<p>“And is it hopeless?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“That is a question I do not like to answer directly,”
said Professor Fuller, smiling. “What
would become of the college if the boys should look
to me to reverse the decisions of the faculty? I have
no such power, you know, nor should I want it. I
would be in hot water all the time. I will say this
much, however: that I sympathize with you heartily,
and that I will see if anything can be done.”</p>

<p>“That is the most we expected,” put in Ray, his
face brightening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t expect too much,” said the professor. “All
that I can do is to see Dr. Drayton and talk the matter
over with him. The whole question rests with
him, and his authority alone will decide it. The rest
of the faculty would be willing enough to relinquish
the condition. What my interview with Dr. Drayton
will result in remains to be seen. He is a man of
strong convictions, as you know, and apt to be especially
set in his way when seriously annoyed.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is very angry,” said I.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it; still there isn’t a better man at
heart to be found than Dr. Drayton, and you can expect
justice. I speak from long experience, for I
knew him as a classmate years ago, and I have lived
close to him the greater part of my life. I will bring
the matter up in a few days, when I think the annoyance
will have passed away. Meantime what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“We will move out into town temporarily,” I answered.
“Of course we cannot attend recitations, nor
go upon the college grounds, but we must stay here at
Belmont for the sake of the ball nine if for nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“It will be best for you to stay for several reasons,”
said the professor. “Have you written to your parents
about the matter?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Better do so at once, and so anticipate the formal
notification which Mr. Dikes will have to send them.
Tell your story in full, and then, when the notification
comes, your parents will understand it. Now as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
your studies. I suppose you intend to keep abreast
of your classes?”</p>

<p>“We would like to,” answered Ray, “but we feared
that we would be unable to do so without the privilege
of attending lectures.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the professor. “Let some one
of your classmates bring you his written notes to copy
each day. You can get Mr. Dikes to tutor you. He
does that sort of work frequently. I strongly advise
this for your own good, and because I know that the
fact that you are conscientiously working to keep up
with your classes will influence Dr. Drayton in your
favor.”</p>

<p>This suggestion we caught at gladly. Under Professor
Fuller’s encouraging words, the affair was rapidly
taking on a more cheerful aspect. We continued
to talk the matter over for some time longer, and
when at length we rose to go, it was with hearts considerably
lightened.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we can thank you for your
kindness,” said Ray earnestly, as we stood by the
door.</p>

<p>“Why, I have done nothing as yet but talk,” answered
the professor, smiling. “Wait a few days,
and we’ll see what can be done. However it may turn
out, don’t be discouraged. Make the best of it, work
hard and you need not be despondent.”</p>

<p>Once more shaking us warmly by the hand, he
bade us good morning, and returned to his library,
while we hastened over to the college to make preparations
for our change of quarters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>SERVING OUR TERM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next morning found us settled in our temporary
lodgings at the house in which my eating club
was located. We had secured a double room on the
second floor, and had transferred our necessary effects
there at the earliest moment.</p>

<p>This had been an especially severe trial for Ray,
who was compelled to relinquish the comforts and
luxury of the beautiful apartments which he loved so
well. It was useless, however, to brood over lost privileges,
for we found our condition much better than
we had expected.</p>

<p>We wrote home, as Professor Fuller had suggested,
and received in reply letters that showed us that our
parents were in sympathy with us, and were not inclined
to judge us severely. Ray’s father informed
him that he had also written to Dr. Drayton concerning
the matter.</p>

<p>When the news became generally known it created
a great flood of feeling among the students, and we
were the objects of sympathetic attention on every
hand. No fear that the fellows would fail to appreciate
our sacrifice. We were fairly lionized. Not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
only did the students come in one after another, personally,
to condole with us, and to offer their services
should we need anything, but we received a formal
vote of thanks from the baseball association for what
they were pleased to term our “patriotic spirit.”</p>

<p>We received so much attention, in fact, that for the
first two or three days we feared that we would never
have a moment to ourselves to keep up our studies.
We found no difficulty in making arrangements for
securing the notes of the college lectures. Tony Larcom,
who wrote a very fair shorthand, promised to
copy out his notes and lend them to me, while Ray
made a similar arrangement with a member of his
class. Mr. Dikes showed himself more than willing to
help us, so we set apart certain evenings of the week
when he would come to our room and tutor us in the
various subjects which our classes were pursuing.</p>

<p>In order that we might secure the necessary leisure
we were compelled to make a rule of being at home
to nobody during certain hours; for we would otherwise
have been fairly overrun with visitors. One of
our most interesting visits occurred on the first evening
we spent in our new quarters.</p>

<p>Tony Larcom was the only one with us at the time,
when a soft rap sounded at the door, and, in response
to our summons to “come in,” the door was opened
gently about a foot, and the head of Percy Randall
was thrust through the aperture. Immediately Tony
Larcom let fly with a book, which hit the door with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
startling thump. The head disappeared like a flash,
and a foot appeared instead.</p>

<p>Finding that hostilities were not renewed, the door
was at length opened wide, and Percy came in. He
approached us with such penitence and humility expressed
in his looks that we could hardly repress a
smile.</p>

<p>“Now, then, you rascal,” said Ray. “What have
you got to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” answered Percy meekly. “I
came here to give you a chance to have your say. I
supposed you’d have lots of great big language saved
up for me, and I am ready to take anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, words won’t do any good,” said I.</p>

<p>“Then maybe you want to kick me,” rejoined Percy.
“Go ahead. Help yourself. I deserve anything.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care for satisfaction of that kind,” answered
Ray, with a laugh. “We can’t undo anything
that has happened. We are in a nice mess on your
account, and you can’t help us out, so we will have to
make the best of it.”</p>

<p>“See here, Ray,” exclaimed Percy earnestly. “I’ll
tell you what I’ll do. I’ll go straight to Dr. Drayton
and make a clean breast of it—tell him that I was
responsible, and get him to suspend me and take you
fellows back. I’ll offer to give him information as
to the leader in the mischief, on condition that he lets
you off your penalty, and then I’ll expose myself.”</p>

<p>“No, that wouldn’t work,” I answered. “Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Drayton would never make such a condition in the
first place——”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if he can make conditions for you,
he can take them, too,” said Percy.</p>

<p>Ray shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “It would be useless and foolhardy
for you to do that. We appreciate your disposition,
Percy, and we thank you for offering, but
you must not think of going to Dr. Drayton. It
would only get you into trouble, while it would do
us no good whatever. They did not suspend us because
they thought we were leaders in the trouble,
but because we had a <em>share</em> in it, and that fact would
not be altered by your confession.”</p>

<p>“Well, it does seem a shame that you fellows who
did the least should suffer for it,” he said, as he
turned away regretfully.</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped now. We can only profit by
experience and keep out of your company on future
occasions,” Ray answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I’m sorry I got you into such a fix,
and I wish with all my heart that I could get you out,”
said Percy. He was standing by the door when I
called after him.</p>

<p>“Say Percy, do you happen to know who it was
that got Ray’s match box from me that night?”</p>

<p>“Len Howard, I think,” answered Percy from the
hall. “He lit the other cannon, I know.”</p>

<p>I turned quickly and looked at Ray, who said nothing,
but merely raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>However severe the penalty we were suffering for
the sake of the old cannons, we had at least the satisfaction
of knowing that it was not in vain. We had
no means of learning, except by rumor, of the effect
of the expedition upon the Park College men, but, from
what we heard, we judged that a tremendous sensation
had been created the morning following, by the
discovery of what had happened while they were
quietly sleeping. They had put themselves to great
pains to rob us of the cannons, and they had been
planning to celebrate their deed with a great jubilee,
so their chagrin and exasperation knew no bounds
when they arose to find the prize had been snatched
out of their very hands.</p>

<p>The students, however, were helpless, for the matter
had gone up into the hands of the faculties of the
two colleges. Considerable correspondence occurred,
and after several days a committee from each faculty
was appointed to confer together. They met and discussed
the question thoroughly, and the result was
that the Park College committee, on behalf of their
college, formally renounced all claims to the cannons
for good. Mutual explanations were made, and the
gates were returned to Berkeley. But, although
these committees parted upon a friendly basis, the
feeling of anger on the part of our students, and the
chagrin of the Park men, only served to stir up the
old, long standing spirit of animosity between the two
colleges to renewed heat.</p>

<p>“There will be exciting times when we meet those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
fellows on the ball field now,” prophesied Tony Larcom.
“It has been bad enough in the past, but now
things will fairly hum. Phew! Methinks I smell
blood already.”</p>

<p>“And this is just the season when we want most to
beat them,” said Ray Wendell.</p>

<p>Our prospects of realizing that end were certainly
very bright. The nine had been practising steadily
each day, and was rapidly getting into shape. Ray
was right when he said we had good material. In
all my college life I do not think I ever saw a more
promising nine. No changes as yet had been found
necessary, and it looked as if we would continue
through the season with the nine as first chosen. The
men were all good individual players, and, under
Ray’s efficient captaincy, they were playing together
with the utmost harmony and precision. Since our
suspension the members of the nine became more devoted
to Ray than ever, and his control over them
was perfect.</p>

<p>Recognizing the extraordinary good chance we had
this season of redeeming Belmont’s baseball record
of the past two years, we bent every nerve to securing
a successful issue, and were regular and assiduous in
practice. As the baseball grounds were situated close
to the lake and beyond the college, we were unable
to reach it conveniently except by a short cut through
the college grounds. Since this was forbidden us,
Tony Larcom devised the plan of meeting us down
by the dock with his boat and rowing us across a portion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
of the lake to the ball ground. In this romantic
and picturesque way we were conducted each day back
and forth from practice.</p>

<p>And so the days passed by while we were busily engaged
in our exercises and studies. We had as yet
heard nothing from either Professor Fuller or Dr.
Drayton, but as we found that we were able, with the
assistance of our copied notes and Mr. Dikes’ instruction,
to keep well up with our classes, our anxieties
had somewhat subsided. We were content to wait
patiently, for the present at least.</p>

<p>The day of our first baseball game approached. We
had finished our last hour of practice, and were
to go over to Dean College the next morning. Ray
had given final instructions to the members of the
nine to retire early and report at our quarters at
eleven o’clock the following day. We were sitting in
our room about half past eight in the evening, discussing
our chances in the series of games that was
about to begin, when we heard a terrific roar in the
hall down stairs. The street door was slammed with
a noise like a pistol shot, then came the sounds of footsteps
clattering up the stairs three steps at a time;
our door was flung wide open, and Tony Larcom
stood before us, his face flushed, his eyes glistening,
waving a letter triumphantly over his head. We
gazed at him in silent astonishment.</p>

<p>“Good news! Good news!” he shouted at the top
of his lungs, although we were scarcely ten feet away.</p>

<p>A premonition of the truth seized us both at once,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and we sprang forward eagerly. Tony tossed the
envelope to Ray.</p>

<p>“There, read that!” he exclaimed, throwing himself
on our bed and kicking his heels in the air.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While Tony lay on the bed in convulsions of joy,
Ray hastily tore open the large, thick envelope, and
drew out two smaller envelopes, both sealed, one of
which was addressed to himself, and the other to me.
Then for several moments there was a silence, broken
only by Tony’s chuckling, while Ray and I eagerly
scanned the contents of our notes. They were both
alike, except for the name, and they ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You are hereby notified, in pursuance of the order of the
faculty at their meeting last evening, that your term of suspension
has been reduced to two weeks, and you will be permitted
therefore to resume your college duties on Monday
morning next, May 11th.</p>

<p class="noic">By order of the Faculty,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ferdinand Dikes</span>, <i>Registrar</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Ray and I looked at each other for an instant, unable
to say a word. Our letters dropped to the floor;
a glad exclamation escaped us, and then we fell forward
into each other’s arms, and hugged each other
in transports of delight.</p>

<p>Tony Larcom, who was sitting on the side of the
bed, watched the demonstration for a while in amused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
silence; and then, unable to keep still, he rose and
joined us. A good natured scrimmage took place,
and the scene was rapidly becoming exciting when a
step sounded on the stairs outside.</p>

<p>“Break away, you fellows; somebody is coming,”
exclaimed Ray.</p>

<p>“Ray, Ray, are you there?” called a strong, cheery
voice from the dark hallway. All three of us recognized
the tones at once. They recalled vividly the
delightful days we had passed at Cedar Hill three
weeks before.</p>

<p>“Why, as I live, it must be father,” cried Ray, as
we turned gladly toward the door, which at that moment
swung open.</p>

<p>“Well, at last!” exclaimed Mr. Wendell—for it
was he. “I thought I would never find you. I have
opened nearly every door in the building, thrust myself
suddenly in on scenes where, I judge, I had no
business to be, and have ventilated every skeleton the
household closets contain. I fear I left the old lady
on the first floor with a palpitation at my unexpected
entrance.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” answered Ray, laughing, and
clasping both his father’s hands affectionately. “Mrs.
Brown is accustomed to surprises: she has kept a student’s
club for twenty years, and you couldn’t startle
her now if you dropped a dynamite cartridge in front
of her. She would simply raise her glasses and say,
‘Well, what is it?’——But the surprise is mostly
mine this time. What brought you on here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“My son’s disgrace,” said Mr. Wendell, with mock
earnestness.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean our suspension,” answered Ray
quietly. “Well, then, I have good news for you.
Read this,” and Ray picked up the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell, who had shaken hands warmly with
Tony and myself, now took a chair, and, putting on his
glasses ran his eyes over the contents of the note.</p>

<p>“When did you receive this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“About twenty minutes ago,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Then I have known all about the matter for about
two hours longer than you,” said Mr. Wendell.</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Ray, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I have been having an interview with Dr. Drayton,”
said Mr. Wendell.</p>

<p>“From all appearances, we seem to be last to hear
the good news,” said Ray. “Tony, how did you come
to know it without opening those letters?”</p>

<p>“I got it out of Mr. Dikes, who gave me the envelopes
to hand you,” answered Tony. “No one
else knows anything about the matter.”</p>

<p>“And how did it all come about?” questioned Ray
eagerly, seating himself on the sofa near his father.
“Tell me everything. How is everybody at home?
How did you come to run on here without letting me
know anything about it? How did you find Dr.
Drayton? And——”</p>

<p>“One question at a time,” interrupted Mr. Wendell
good naturedly. “Let us start at the very beginning.
In the first place, everybody is well at home. Your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
mother sends her love and sympathy. I telegraphed
her the good news just a short time ago. You did
very well, Ray, to write me at once about the matter,
explaining everything. It saved both your mother
and myself a great deal of anxiety. I suppose, Mr.
Elder, you did the same thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I answered, “and I received letters from
both my parents. My father was called South on
business, but he wrote me a long letter, and took
very much the same view of the case as you did in
your letter to Ray. You see we have compared correspondence
for our mutual comfort,” I added.</p>

<p>“Well, you were both in rather hard luck,” said
Mr. Wendell, “but I think we have it all straightened
out now. I won’t keep you in doubt any longer, but
will tell you the whole story from the first. I mentioned,
I think, in my letter to Ray that I had also
written to Dr. Drayton. The result of that was some
considerable correspondence with him, also with this
Professor Fuller whom Ray mentioned in his letter,
and whom I find to be a very influential member of
the faculty. As I had business in Boston to-morrow,
it occurred to me that I would do well to come a day
earlier, stop over here for a few hours, and see what
an interview could effect. Judging from the tone of
the letters I received, I imagined that it would be best
to visit this Professor Fuller first. I fancied that he
would be franker and more open with me, and I
could get a better and more complete understanding
of both sides of the affair from him. Accordingly I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
went to his house as soon as I arrived here; and I
must say I found him a delightful man, and all that
your enthusiastic descriptions of him have led me to
believe. From him I learned that the faculty had
resolved last evening to let you off with two weeks.
Although Professor Fuller did not say so, I could
easily infer from his words that he had been chiefly
instrumental in bringing about a reconsideration of
your case. He has certainly used his influence in your
behalf, and he told me that he had talked the matter
over several times with Dr. Drayton, until the president
at length consented to bring it up before the
faculty. Boys you have a good friend in Professor
Fuller.”</p>

<p>“No one knows that better than we do,” responded
Ray quickly. “Professor Fuller promised us nothing,
but we knew him of old, and we felt confident
of his friendship. We shall never forget his kindness
as long as we live.”</p>

<p>“He is certainly a very fine man,” continued Mr.
Wendell, “and—and”—here he hesitated a moment
while a mischievous twinkle came into his eye—“and,
from the brief but pleasant conversation that I enjoyed
with somebody in the hallway at the end of
my call, I should say that Professor Fuller had not
only a nice disposition but a very nice daughter. Miss
Nellie is the name, I think, eh?”</p>

<p>“Miss Nettie,” said I, correcting him.</p>

<p>“Nettie, yes, that’s the name; and a fine girl she is,
too. Full of life and spirits. She takes your part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
royally. Hers is a friendship you ought to be proud
of. How is it, Ray, you said nothing about Miss
Nettie in your letter?”</p>

<p>Ray said nothing now. He was looking at a picture
on the opposite wall. His father was enjoying
the situation in his good natured, teasing way.</p>

<p>After a silence of several seconds’ duration Mr.
Wendell, with an expression of increased mirth, suddenly
asked:</p>

<p>“What was that you said?”</p>

<p>“I said nothing,” answered Ray, with a quiet smile,
still gazing at the picture. “Miss Nettie is a very
nice young lady, and we are very grateful for her
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said his father, with a laugh, “then I suppose
we will have to let it go that way. To return;
I thanked Professor Fuller for the interest he had
shown in the matter, and went over to see Dr. Drayton.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Wendell took off his glasses, wiped them,
and returned them to his pocket.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he continued after a pause, “tell me honestly,
what do you think of Dr. Drayton?”</p>

<p>“To be perfectly candid, Mr. Wendell,” I answered,
“I think that, while Dr. Drayton does everything for
the best, he has very little tact, and hardly any knowledge
of the character of students. It seems very presumptuous
in me to criticise our college president in
this way, no doubt, but the instances have been so
numerous in which he has totally misunderstood the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
fellows that I cannot help saying so. It really seems
surprising that a man who has been president of a
college for ten years should know so little about the
nature of boys. He is an excellent scholar, a splendid
teacher, and as a rule a good disciplinarian, but every
now and then he shows himself altogether out of sympathy
with the students, and in such cases is very apt
to judge us unfairly.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think, Ray?” asked his father,
turning to his son.</p>

<p>“Well, I have avoided saying much about Dr. Drayton
to you in the past,” answered Ray, “for the very
reason that my views coincide with Harry Elder’s.”</p>

<p>“And how about you?” asked Mr. Wendell of Tony
Larcom.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think Dr. Drayton is an old <em>dodo</em>,” answered
Tony recklessly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell mastered an inclination to smile.</p>

<p>“Your opinion is ruled out of court,” he said with
as much gravity as he could summon.</p>

<p>Tony subsided.</p>

<p>“I am sure I do not know what you mean by ‘want
of tact,’” continued Mr. Wendell.</p>

<p>“Well, take our own case for example,” answered
Ray. “Now, no one who understands human nature
at all would ask a student point blank to betray some
of his companions in mischief. Almost any one would
know that such a question would not only obtain no
satisfactory answer, but would arouse in the student
a bitter feeling of opposition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“And did Dr. Drayton ask you such a question?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. My match box of course betrayed me,
and when I told the faculty I had loaned the box
shortly before the cannons were discharged, Dr. Drayton
pressed me to tell the name of the person to whom
I gave it. Of course I wouldn’t answer that.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” echoed Mr. Wendell thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Then again,” continued Ray, “think of the way
in which this condition about baseball was presented
to us. The length of our penalty was made to hang
upon our decision as to playing baseball, which had
no more to do with the question than sailing on the
lake or some other amusement. I think I understand
Dr. Drayton partially. He is a man who, when he
wants a thing, goes the straightest way to get it, regardless
of all considerations. He wanted to know
who some of the other fellows were, so without thinking
twice he simply asks me to tell on them. He felt
that we were giving too much time to baseball, and he
doesn’t seem to sympathize with our games much anyhow,
so he drags in this condition, and hopes to <em>force</em>
us into giving up baseball. It was not fair. He
might just as well have said that the faculty would
make our suspension only two weeks, provided we
would promise to eat only two meals a day and devote
the time we would gain thereby to our studies.
We are as anxious to stand well in our classes as he
is to have us do so, and if I felt that baseball would
really interfere, I would give it up. But I don’t,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and as I had your permission to play baseball, I would
not accept Dr. Drayton’s conditions.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell paused a moment before answering.</p>

<p>“Like father, like son,” he said at length. “You
have said in substance almost exactly what I told Dr.
Drayton myself, except, of course, I spoke to him in
the respectful manner becoming his office. I told
him that I had no objections to your playing ball, and
that I saw no reason why it should affect the terms
of your suspension. I won’t go all over the ground
again. Suffice it to say that we had a very plain and,
on the whole, agreeable interview. You see, there
wasn’t very much to be said, for I knew the faculty
had decided to let you back, and I was inclined to let
well enough alone. I am precisely of your opinion
concerning Dr. Drayton. He <em>does</em> mean well, and
is particularly anxious that his students shall succeed;
but, as you say, he is lacking in tact somewhat. He
gave me a clear understanding of his side of the matter,
however, and I think it is just as well for you to
know it.</p>

<p>“He told me he was deeply interested in seeing
you both do well in your studies, that he recognized
the damage that a five weeks’ suspension would do
you, and was most willing to decrease the time. He
said, however, that he felt that it was only just, when
the faculty showed its interest in your success by remitting
a large part of this penalty, that you should
show your appreciation of this by making some concession
on your part. The concession he asked was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
that you should give up baseball, which he believed
was doing your studies almost as much harm as the
suspension. I removed this impression from his
mind, or at least, finished doing so, for Professor Fuller
had already done most of it, and Dr. Drayton is
quite ready to take you back, and treat you well. His
annoyance has entirely passed away. I gave him a
frank idea of a parent’s view of college sports indulged
in in moderation, and I think I have partially
altered his opinions in the matter.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “if Dr. Drayton had presented
the question to us in the way you mention it would
have been different.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” remarked Ray, “it is better as it is,
for now we are readmitted without any condition.”</p>

<p>“It is all over now, and you certainly have come
out of it pretty well, all things considered,” said Mr.
Wendell, “and my mind is immensely relieved. I am
especially pleased to know that you have kept up your
studies. Dr. Drayton spoke of that with considerable
commendation. I hope you have lost no ground.”</p>

<p>“None at all, I think,” answered Ray. “I am
sure we are well abreast of our class.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” broke in Tony. “Having the advantage
of lectures and recitations, I used to ask Harry
questions and try to coach him, but I soon found that
he knew more about the subjects than I did, so I left
him alone, in order to keep my own self respect.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“How far is it to the depot?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“About ten minutes’ walk,” answered Ray. “But
surely you are not going home so soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his father, “I must be in Boston early
to-morrow morning, so I must leave here on the 10:30
train. As my valise is at the hotel I had better start
now.”</p>

<p>All three of us accompanied Mr. Wendell, who kept
up a stream of questions about our plans and purposes.</p>

<p>“The last time I saw you three, you were busy
with baseball practice out on our lawn at Cedar Hill.
You must come out again, and stay longer. I always
like to have plenty of live stock on the place,” he
said jokingly.</p>

<p>“Nothing would please us better,” I answered.
“We shall never forget the delightful week we spent
at Cedar Hill.”</p>

<p>“How is your baseball nine?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Very good,” answered Ray. “We have seldom
had a better nine.”</p>

<p>“Going to win the championship?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Ray. “We stand a good chance.”</p>

<p>“Well, the boys ought to win, if for no other reason
than to show their gratitude for your devotion to
their interest,” said Mr. Wendell. “When does your
season open?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” I answered. “We play Dean College
the first game.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you will make short work of them?”</p>

<p>“We don’t anticipate much trouble in that direction,”
I said. “Dean College has always stood last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
on the list, and we count confidently on a victory over
her. We would stand a small show for the championship
if we could not beat the Dean men.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you luck,” said Mr. Wendell, as
we reached the depot, “and I am very glad that this
other matter has been settled satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the train came in.</p>

<p>“Good by,” said Mr. Wendell, shaking hands all
round. “Be good boys now, and keep out of mischief.
Give my kindest regards to Professor Fuller,
Ray, when next you see him—and don’t forget Miss
Nettie,” he added, as the train moved off.</p>

<small>THE FIRST GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>About half past ten the next morning Ray and I
stood at our accustomed place beside the dock awaiting
the approach of Tony Larcom’s rowboat, which
was to take us over to the baseball grounds, as it
had done daily during the past two weeks.</p>

<p>“This is your last trip,” said Tony, as he shot his
boat along close to the dock, and drew in his oars,
“and for my part I am quite agreeable to a change.
I think five weeks of this would have made me tired
of my boat. My conscience has troubled me greatly
about this aiding of two disreputable scamps to defeat
the purposes of a college faculty. It is too much
like convict trade. I am glad it is over and my conscience
can rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tony,” said Ray, “your conscience needs
rest sadly, for, if it is any good at all, it must have
been severely taxed during late years on your own
account, to say nothing of the ‘disreputable scamps’
you speak of.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll let it rest, then,” laughed Tony. Two
strokes of the oars sent us well out, and we were on
our way to the ball ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Our first duty that morning had been to see Professor
Fuller, who congratulated us on getting back,
and added to our pleasure by telling us that we might
move back our things to our rooms that very evening,
so as to be able to begin our duties on Monday
morning without further interruption. This, of
course, was particularly welcome news to Ray, who
longed to be back in his old apartments. Professor
Fuller would listen to no thanks, but assured us that
our own good conduct had brought about a reconsideration
of the matter. We left him seated on his
piazza, with Sport’s silky brown head resting on his
knee, and bestowing upon the old dog a share of the
affectionate spirit that ever flowed in a natural stream
from the great warm heart of the man.</p>

<p>When we reached our landing place, clambered up
the bank, and crossed the road to the ball field, we
found the rest awaiting us. As Dean College was
only four miles away, we rode over in an omnibus,
and, to facilitate matters, we dressed ourselves in our
uniforms before starting. On this occasion we used
our new suits for the first time, and found ourselves
remarkably well pleased with them, both in the fit and
colors. The dark blue stockings and braid trimmings,
together with the light gray material of which our
knickerbockers and blouses were made, presented a
very neat and pretty effect.</p>

<p>We received a round of cheers, as we emerged from
the clubhouse, and started off, accompanied by two
more omnibuses filled with fellow students who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
going over to see the game. The day had been very
bright and clear when we started, but towards twelve
o’clock clouds began to gather, and the sky assumed
a rather threatening aspect. We watched these symptoms
at first with anxiety, but, as no rain fell, we were
led to hope that the afternoon would pass without any
interruption of our game by the weather.</p>

<p>We reached Dean about half past twelve, and were
received pleasantly by several members of the nine,
who were awaiting us at the entrance of the college
grounds. As there was no hotel in the village, we
were conducted to one of the eating clubs, where
provision had been made for us.</p>

<p>Immediately after lunch, we walked over to the
ball grounds, which were situated close to the college.
We were very early, for the game was not to be
called until two o’clock, so we spent the next half
hour in preliminary practice while the crowd of spectators
slowly assembled. Each man stood in his position
while I batted balls about in various directions.
Everything went smoothly. The fellows played in
excellent form, with the exception of Fred Harrison,
the first baseman, who seemed a little flurried.</p>

<p>“It is quite natural,” I said to Tony Larcom, who
stood beside me, and had remarked on the matter.
“This is Fred Harrison’s first game, and he may be
a trifle nervous. It will soon wear off.”</p>

<p>At about quarter before two o’clock, the gong on
the grand stand sounded, and we left the field to
make way for the Dean men. We watched their practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
with interest, and noted that they were playing
no better than usual. We felt no cause to fear for
the result of the game, and accordingly, when time
was called, we began with confident assurance of victory.</p>

<p>Dean won the toss, and, therefore, took the field,
while Dick Palmer picked out his bat and stepped
to the home plate. The second ball pitched he struck
far out and past left field, and reached second base
in safety. Ray came next to the bat, and made a
single base hit, thus bringing Dick home, and scoring
the first run.</p>

<p>A chorus of cheers sounded from the two omnibuses
at the side of the field, where our friends were gathered,
and Dick took his seat with a smile. I was
next at the bat, and secured a base hit, which sent
Ray to second base. Then Harold Pratt knocked a
high fly, which was captured. He was succeeded by
George Ives, who had the exceedingly bad taste to
strike out. Frank Holland, however, made a safe
hit, and gave Ray his third base, while I reached
second base.</p>

<p>The bases were now full—a glorious opportunity
for the next batter, Alfred Burnett, who had the
chance of bringing in three more runs with a safe
hit. And yet, in the face of this opportunity, Burnett
struck up in the air, and the ball was caught, thus
closing out our side with three of us on bases.</p>

<p>I mention this as an instance of the miserable luck
that pursued us throughout this game. Certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
fickle goddess of fortune that presides over baseball
fields had determined to place every possible difficulty
in our path. She manifested her evil influence in
three ways. In the first place, in situations such as
described above, and which occurred again and again
during the game until we were fairly exasperated.
Secondly, in the weather. The clouds, which had
been threatening from the start, began to drop rain
at occasional brief periods; and these small showers
invariably occurred when most disadvantageous to us.
Thirdly, the umpire—that old time bone of contention—without
intending in the least to be partial, decided
in several successive and important instances
against us.</p>

<p>To add to all this, the nervousness which I had
noticed in Fred Harrison grew steadily worse as the
game advanced. He seemed to lose his head almost
entirely at the bat and struck out three out of the
four times he came up, while he showed himself sadly
demoralized while playing in the field. It was surprising,
for Harrison had played well during our days
of practice, and of course this change had a bad influence
on the rest of the nine.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these disadvantages, we maintained
a lead throughout the game until the eighth
inning. The score then stood 6 to 4 in our favor, and
it looked as if we would finish at those figures. All
things considered, we would have been glad to get
away with such a record. In the last half of the
eighth inning the Dean men succeeded in getting two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
single base hits. Then came a long hit to right field,
which Lewis Page captured in fine style, but which
enabled the two runners to gain a base, so that they
now stood on third and second respectively. I succeeded
in striking the next man out, so we had but
to dispose of one more batter to close the inning.</p>

<p>We all bent ourselves eagerly to the work. I used
all possible care and judgment in pitching, and confidently
hoped to win the point, for the man at the bat
was a weak striker. At the third ball pitched he
struck wildly, and tipped the ball high in the air for
a pop fly, straight over Fred Harrison’s head. Of
course the two men on the bases risked the chance of
the ball landing safe, and ran around toward home.
It all depended on Fred Harrison, who moved backward,
and stood waiting for the descent of the ball.</p>

<p>From the manner in which he moved about and
shifted his hands, I could see that he was more nervous
than ever, and I trembled for the results. I will be
fair enough to say that it was no easy fly to catch,
especially for a baseman inclined to be nervous. Fred
Harrison was all this. He was thinking no doubt of
all that depended on his play, while the ball hung
there in the air, so that, by the time it reached him,
he had lost his head completely, and made a frantic
grab at it which proved utterly futile. The ball went
through his hands, and dropped to the ground, while
the two runners scored, and the game stood 6 to 6.</p>

<p>The next man was put out without trouble, and
the inning closed. The crowd in the grand stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
had suppressed their joy as well as possible out of
respect to our feelings, but we could not have found
fault with any demonstration, for their gain had come
so unexpectedly that an outburst of cheers would
have been natural. We were out of spirits, and played
poorly at the bat during the first half of the ninth
inning, the result being that we were retired without
a run. It was only when the last of the three men
was out that we realized our predicament, and prepared
for a desperate tug.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” said Ray quietly, but setting his lips
firmly, “our reputation is at stake now. You know
your duty, so don’t fail. We simply <em>must</em> put those
men out in one, two, three order. Then we can make
up our lost ground.”</p>

<p>The first man, however, got his base, and, on a
passed ball of Dick Palmer’s, he reached second.
The next two men we disposed of readily; one of
them, however, made a sacrifice hit that sent the runner
to third base. There were now two out. I
pitched a slow outcurve to the next man, who caught
it on the end of his bat, and sent it flying along the
grounds to my right, but not close enough for me to
reach it. George Ives dashed to one side, picked it
up neatly, and tossed it to Fred Harrison.</p>

<p>George was a strong thrower, and may perhaps
have thrown a little to one side, but the ball was
within easy reach of Harrison’s hands. The latter,
however, in his nervousness, again misjudged the ball;
it struck on the tips of his fingers and bounded away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
while the runner on third base reached the home plate,
and the game was lost to us by a score of 7 to 6.</p>

<p>The delight of the Dean men may be imagined.
They ran about shouting and hugging one another,
while we stood for several seconds in our various
positions almost unable to realize the truth. Laughing
and cheering, the crowd moved off toward the
gate, while we despondently gathered up our things
and walked silently toward our omnibus.</p>

<p>There we found our friends, but none of them inclined
to say anything. There was simply nothing
to say. Having gone into the game with feelings
of the utmost confidence, our chagrin and humiliation
passed all expression. I looked at no one. I simply
wanted to be alone—to bury myself in some place
where I could not see the reproachful and disappointed
eyes that I knew would look upon our return.</p>

<p>But even reproach and disappointment were not
the worst I feared. I expected ridicule, for the idea
of being beaten by Dean College seemed absurd.
Such a thing had never been known at Belmont.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me there is no such thing as luck in
baseball,” said Tony Larcom’s voice behind me.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I exclaimed impatiently. “What has
luck to do with us? With all our hard luck we would
have won, but for—— Well, never mind. He feels
it no doubt worse than the rest of us, so let us spare
him any criticism.”</p>

<p>“Just think what a jubilee the Park men will hold
to-night when they hear the news! Oh, what can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
have gotten into the boys anyhow, to let these fellows
get away with us?” said Dick Palmer bitterly.</p>

<p>“It is all clear enough to me,” I answered, “but it
will do no good to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Small chance we stand for the Crimson Banner
now,” said somebody.</p>

<p>“Oh, for goodness’ sake, let us get away and say
no more,” I exclaimed, turning abruptly on my heel.
“I can’t bear to think of it.”</p>

<p>We hurried into our omnibus, and, in silence, the
three vehicles left the grounds that had been the scene
of our disastrous encounter. Though probably much
conversation took place in the other omnibuses that
would have been unpleasant for us to hear, in our own
very little was said. This was chiefly out of respect
to poor Fred Harrison, who sat on the front seat, with
his chin on his hand.</p>

<p>I was sitting next to Ray Wendell, so I took advantage
of the opportunity to ask him in a low tone,
unheard by the rest:</p>

<p>“Well, Ray, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he answered slowly. “Fred
was so good in practice. He has disappointed me severely.
I do not despair, for I think we can beat
Park College yet, and there will be some satisfaction
in that, but,” he added in a still lower tone, “we will
have to make one change in the nine. That is settled.”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, for I understood him perfectly.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for Fred, and I pity him sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
now, for I know that he is fully aware of the
blame that rests on him, and that he is correspondingly
unhappy, but he must go. We can’t keep him
on the nine a day longer. He has about ruined our
chances now——”</p>

<p>Ray was here interrupted by a general exclamation
of alarm.</p>

<p>“Stop the horses, quick,” cried some one.</p>

<p>Turning hastily we looked forward to see what
had occurred. The front seat of the omnibus beside
the driver was <em>empty</em>. Fred Harrison, who had been
leaning well forward, had suddenly disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<small>FRED HARRISON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The driver of the omnibus gave his reins a sharp
tug that brought his horses up on their haunches.
They became frightened, and kicked viciously in their
traces. This added to the general feeling of alarm.</p>

<p>There was an awful hush for a moment as we
thought of the possible fate our unfortunate companion
might meet from the cruel hoofs of the startled
animals. Then several of us sprang hastily to the
ground.</p>

<p>Between two of the spokes of the front wheel protruded
a leg, clad in the dark blue of our ball suits,
while, huddled up under the omnibus, lay the body of
Fred Harrison. How he could have got into such an
entangled position it is impossible to say, but it was
only by a miracle that he had escaped being crushed
and mangled. One more turn of the wheel would
have doubtless proven fatal.</p>

<p>Without an instant’s delay two of us crept under
the body of the omnibus, and, carefully avoiding the
blows of the horses’ hoofs, drew Fred gently out,
and laid him upon his side on the grass. He seemed
scarcely to breathe; his face was pale and still. Ray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
dropped on his knees, and put his hand upon the
poor fellow’s breast.</p>

<p>“Run, get some water quick,” he said.</p>

<p>We turned in consternation and looked about us.
Where should we go? We were on a deserted country
road. There were no houses in sight to which
we could apply for assistance, no stream near by from
which we could procure water. We were utterly
helpless and alone. The other omnibuses containing
our companions had disappeared in the distance ahead
of us.</p>

<p>“Oh! what shall we do?” I exclaimed. “Is there
no way we can help the poor fellow?”</p>

<p>“I think he has only fainted,” said Ray, with his
face close to Fred’s. “We must find something to
bring him to.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Tony Larcom uttered a quick exclamation
of relief, and leaped back into the omnibus, where
he began searching under the seat for something.</p>

<p>“I have it,” he cried, as he joined us again, carrying
in his hand a large bottle full of the raw whisky
which we used to bathe bruises and sprains. “Here,
use this. It is pretty bad stuff to swallow, but it will
help him.”</p>

<p>Ray seized the bottle, and placing it to Fred’s
mouth, forced his lips open. A few swallows produced
an almost immediate change. Fred took a
long breath, moaned once or twice, then opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment he seemed surprised, but this expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
quickly gave way to one of pain. He uttered
a sharp cry and again closed his eyes. The
color had entirely forsaken his lips. Evidently he had
sustained some injury of which we knew nothing.
We attempted to raise him up in order to make his
position more comfortable, when he gave vent to another
cry.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Tony Larcom. “No
wonder the poor fellow suffers! Look at his right
arm. It must be broken.”</p>

<p>For the first time we noticed that Fred’s arm hung
limp and distorted. The shirt at the elbow was torn,
and disclosed an ugly looking bruise from which the
blood was slowly oozing.</p>

<p>“He must have been kicked by the horses,” said
Ray. “Here, fellows, we ought not to delay a minute,
but get him into the hands of a doctor as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, we lifted him as gently as the circumstances
permitted, and laid him upon one of the
cushioned seats of the omnibus. He made little noise
while we handled him. He seemed to have fainted
again with pain. We rested him upon his left side
so that his right arm should lie quietly and without
contact. Then Ray sat at his head, bathing his face,
while I sat at his feet to hold him still and to prevent
the rolling of the omnibus from jarring him.</p>

<p>Fortunately the road was smooth, so we were able
to make good time on the way home.</p>

<p>The episode had driven everything else from our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
mind. Even the game and our humiliating defeat
were forgotten in our solicitude for the unfortunate
student who lay groaning on the seat beside us.</p>

<p>“How did it all come about?” asked Ray. “What
made him fall in that way?”</p>

<p>“It is a perfect mystery,” answered George Ives,
who had been sitting just beside Harrison. “He was
sitting there quietly on the front seat, with his head
in his hand. I thought he had a headache, or perhaps
was feeling badly broken up over the game, but I
didn’t suppose for a moment that there was anything
else the matter with him. Suddenly I saw him sway
from side to side unsteadily, and before I or the
driver could catch him, he fell head foremost down
upon the traces, and rolled under the omnibus. How
he caught in that wheel I can’t imagine, but he must
have been dragged several feet before we stopped.”</p>

<p>“Has Fred been complaining of being unwell?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Not to me,” said George. “I must say I can’t
understand him to-day at all.”</p>

<p>“I think he simply lost his head,” I answered.
“It was his first game of ball. He was very anxious
to do well, and became nervous. Of course this grew
worse as he found himself playing badly.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but how do you explain his tumbling over
in this strange way?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>“I suppose the fatigue of the game, and its discouraging
results, may have reacted on his nerves and
produced vertigo,” I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“I hardly believe that,” said Ray. “There must
be some reason. I don’t know what to think. I
thought I had judged Harrison correctly when we
chose him for the nine. I counted on some little
nervousness, for he is a Freshman, and has had no
experience on the ball field, but I did not look for such
a complete demoralization as this to-day. Did any
of you speak much to him during the game? Did
you notice how confused his ideas seemed to be?
Why, in the fourth inning, when we took the field, he
started to go to third base instead of first, and only
stopped when I spoke to him. Were such a thing
possible, I could almost believe the fellow had been
drugged.”</p>

<p>I had reached out at this moment to place Fred’s
right arm in a more comfortable position, when my
hand struck something hard which protruded partly
from his inside coat pocket.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” I exclaimed, drawing it out
to view.</p>

<p>It was a small brandy flask, half emptied.</p>

<p>“Jerusalem, the boy has been drinking!” cried
Tony Larcom, as the whole truth of the affair suddenly
dawned on him.</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” said Frank Holland, who was
a classmate of Harrison’s. “It was only last night
that Fred told me that he was going to be nervous
to-day, and said that he wished he could take something
to strengthen him. I told him that he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
be only the worse for it, and so he said no more
about it.”</p>

<p>Ray had taken the bottle from me.</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is true,” he said.</p>

<p>“No wonder he was upset,” said Tony. “He
must have been fairly stupefied. What on earth possessed
him to do such a thing? He knew the rule
that no member of the nine should touch stimulants.”</p>

<p>“He has certainly made a bad mistake,” said Ray.
“I wish I could have advised him in time.”</p>

<p>Little more was to be said. The matter seemed
clear enough now, and foolish as Fred Harrison had
been, we could only pity him in his present helpless
condition.</p>

<p>We reached Belmont about six o’clock, and drove
immediately to the dormitory where Fred roomed.
One of our number was despatched for a doctor,
while others carried the still partially unconscious
student up to his room.</p>

<p>The doctor arrived in a few minutes, and made a
hasty examination.</p>

<p>“The arm is not broken,” he said. “It is slightly
dislocated. Two or three of you hold him tightly a
moment.”</p>

<p>We followed his directions at once. Then the doctor
planted his foot firmly against the bed, grasped
the arm with both hands, bent and twisted it until we
thought he would sever it from the body, and then
suddenly turned it skilfully back into its proper position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>During the operation Fred had cried incessantly
with pain, but when the bone had resumed its place,
his muscles relaxed, and his head sank back with a
long sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The doctor was now examining his wrist.</p>

<p>“There is a sprain here that will probably give
him trouble for two or three weeks,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else to do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing but to make him easy,” he answered. “I
will treat his arm and wrist and bind them up. Then
one of you had better remain with him to attend to
his wants.”</p>

<p>Tony Larcom, being the only one of us in his ordinary
clothes, consented to stay, while Ray and I
agreed to change our suits and return immediately
after dinner to relieve Tony. Dick Palmer had already
gone over to the telegraph office to send word
to Fred’s parents, who lived at Springfield. Feeling
that everything had been done to contribute to the
invalid’s comfort, the rest of us took our departure,
leaving Fred in the hands of Tony and the doctor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<small>CAUGHT IN THE ACT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Ah, this is like old times!” exclaimed Ray with
genuine satisfaction, as he sunk back into the large
easy chair that stood by the hearth in his front room.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. “It seems months since we
were in these rooms before. They appear to have
been well cared for; no dust anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I told the janitor I was going to return this
evening, so he was in here during the morning cleaning.
Now let us light up the gas and make ourselves
comfortable.”</p>

<p>Ray scratched a match, and lit every burner in the
room. “An illumination in honor of our return,” he
called out, while I put down the parcels I had carried
over for Ray, and dropped on the sofa, stretching
myself out at ease.</p>

<p>At dinner Ray had asked me to help him to get
a few of his things over from the room we had occupied,
as he was anxious to take possession of his
old apartments without delay. Accordingly we gathered
his necessities together, and brought them with
us on our way back to Fred Harrison’s room, where
we expected to find Tony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>We discovered, however, that Harrison’s roommate
had come in during our absence, and had relieved
Tony, who had gone away shortly before we arrived.
We found Fred resting quietly, and, though still suffering
some pain, much improved in condition. He
seemed greatly distressed when he saw us, and in a
broken and almost tearful voice confessed having taken
brandy before the game, and condemned himself for
his folly in unmeasured terms.</p>

<p>The sorry exhibition he had made of himself, and
the injury he had sustained, affected him but little.
These he regarded as but the natural consequents of
his foolish act, which he fully deserved; but that the
college should have suffered so humiliating a defeat
through his weakness grieved him most, and he could
find no words of self reproach severe enough. We
comforted him as best we could, and then left him
with the promise that we would call the next morning.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Ray, as he drew the heavy curtains
to, “I could almost feel reconciled even to our
absurd defeat, it is so pleasant to get back here again.
We can lie off and look at the matter calmly and
comfortably.” Here he resumed his chair.</p>

<p>“Comfortably, I own, but scarcely calmly yet,” I
answered. “I am already suffering in anticipation,
under the reproachful looks of the students. We will
have to face them all to-morrow, and, for my part,
I must say I am scarcely equal to the ordeal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I don’t mind that,” said Ray. “Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
I think you exaggerate the matter. I don’t
think the fellows will make us feel uncomfortable.
We did our level best and they know it. They know
as well as we do what lost us the game; and, in view
of his hard luck, they will treat poor Fred with the
utmost indulgence.”</p>

<p>“But just think of our condition now. Our
chances for the championship are lost. This defeat
is a damper from which we are not likely to recover
during the whole season. I don’t see how you can
look at that calmly,” I said, with some show of impatience.</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Ray, with a smile, “I must be
brutal enough to say that I do. Perhaps you are
right about the championship. The prospects are
certainly not encouraging now, but I still hold the
conviction that we can beat Park College, and there
will be infinite satisfaction to me in that.”</p>

<p>“What change of positions on the nine have you
in mind?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’d put Harold Pratt on first base,” said Ray.
“He is tall and has a long reach. Then, for a new
third baseman, I should choose Percy Randall by all
means.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had enough of Percy Randall?” I
asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“In one way, yes, quite enough,” answered Ray,
“but on the nine and under my control, I think he
would make an excellent man.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” I said, after a moment’s consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
“The man isn’t born who could rattle
Percy Randall.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he will be glad enough to play,” observed
Ray.</p>

<p>“Glad!” I answered. “He will never cease to
thank us for another opportunity to get even with
those Park men. He will play like a young tiger.”</p>

<p>“I think the best thing we can do then is to notify
him at once,” said Ray. “I have some of the letter
heads of the Baseball Association in my desk. I will
write without delay and tell him to be on hand Monday
noon for practice.”</p>

<p>Ray rose, and went to the roll top desk which
stood near one of the windows. Taking his key from
his pocket, he fitted one into the lock and tried to turn
it. It caught in some way and would not move.
Pressing on the sliding top, the desk, to his surprise,
opened readily.</p>

<p>“Why, it is unlocked!” he exclaimed. “That is
very curious. I am very sure that I locked it when
I left two weeks ago, and nobody—why, confound
it! What is all this?”</p>

<p>I got up hastily and joined him.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Matter enough. Look at the confusion here—the
ink bottle upset all over a lot of my papers, and
everything turned topsy turvy. Oh, this is simply exasperating!
I put everything away with scrupulous
care in this desk. There are papers here that I
wouldn’t have touched for anything. I suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
stupid old janitor has upset things in moving the
desk.”</p>

<p>“But why was it unlocked?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea. I am sure I did not
leave it so, for I kept valuable things here. In this
drawer I kept my bank deposit book.”</p>

<p>Ray opened the drawer as he spoke. It was <em>perfectly
empty</em>. He looked at me in speechless astonishment
as he fumbled about in the vacant drawer.</p>

<p>“Why, the old thief,” he burst out angrily, “he
must have been robbing me this morning. Here, wait
a minute, I’ll find out about this,” and Ray dashed
out into the hall.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes he returned with a puzzled
and bewildered expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Learn anything?” I asked.</p>

<p>Ray shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am further off than before. Old Jarvis swears
that he hasn’t been in the room,” he said.</p>

<p>“But I thought you said he had been cleaning up
here this morning,” I remarked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“So I believed, but he tells me that Ridley was the
only one who came in, and that he spent not more
than fifteen minutes here, dusting around a little.
Ridley says that he tried to open the desk in order
to clean it out, but found it locked.”</p>

<p>“Then it was locked this morning?”</p>

<p>“If they say what is true. I don’t know whether
to believe them or not, appearances are so bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“I can hardly believe that either Ridley or old
Jarvis would steal in that way,” I said.</p>

<p>“I hate to think so, but what other solution is there?
They certainly did not act or speak as if they had
done it. Both of them were badly worried over it,
but they seemed to be innocent. I told them that the
thief could be traced by the bank book.”</p>

<p>“That is no severe loss,” I said, “for you can advise
the bank about the matter without delay, and they
will watch out for the fellow that took it.”</p>

<p>“No, that does not make me uneasy,” answered
Ray. “It is the doubt about the thief that troubles
me. I wonder whether he disturbed anything else.”</p>

<p>Ray took out a match and entered the adjoining
room. Scarcely a second had passed after he disappeared
from view, when there came a sharp, quick
cry, then a succession of harsh exclamations, the rapid
shuffling of feet, and the sounds of a fierce struggle.
It lasted but a moment, and before I had time to realize
the situation, and hurry to Ray’s assistance, before
I had half reached the door, Ray emerged from the
darkness of the other room, panting heavily, and
dragging by the neck a crouching, struggling fellow
who was fighting hard to shake himself loose.</p>

<p>We seized him roughly, and together threw him
upon the sofa, Ray putting one hand upon his breast.</p>

<p>Then for the first time the full light of the gas fell
on the face of our captive. It was Len Howard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<small>A TERRIBLE CONFESSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ray staggered back.</p>

<p>“Howard—you here!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Howard said nothing, but remained gazing doggedly
at the floor.</p>

<p>“Answer me!” cried Ray, as the first shock of
surprise subsided. “What are you doing in this
room?”</p>

<p>Howard replied hesitatingly, as if scarcely knowing
what to say:</p>

<p>“I saw the door open—and—and when Ridley
went out into the hall for a moment—I—I stepped
in, thinking you might have returned. Ridley closed
the door and locked me in.”</p>

<p>As the door was fastened by a spring lock, easily
opened from the inside, the transparency of this excuse
was pitiable, and showed how desperate was
Howard’s position.</p>

<p>“And I suppose, not finding me here, you determined
to await my return,” said Ray, suppressing his
feelings with difficulty.</p>

<p>Howard remained silent.</p>

<p>“And in the interval you occupied yourself looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
over my things,” continued Ray, pointing to his desk.</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>“Howard,” said Ray contemptuously, “what are
we to think of you?”</p>

<p>“Think what you choose,” answered Howard bitterly.
“Think the worst of me. Every one will
think the same in a few days.”</p>

<p>Ray did not seem to notice the significance of these
words.</p>

<p>“Do you realize that you are committing a crime?”
he said. “Don’t you know that I could have you
arrested for this?”</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Howard; “but why should
I care now?”</p>

<p>“Care!” exclaimed Ray, aghast at the other’s tone.
“Have you no respect for your good name?”</p>

<p>“Good name!” echoed Howard, still more bitterly.
“Where will that be in a day or two? No, I have
no reason to respect my ‘good name.’ I own that I
came in here dishonestly. Go on, then, and expose
me.”</p>

<p>“I did not say I was going to expose you,” answered
Ray.</p>

<p>“But you will,” said Howard. “What else should
I expect from you?”</p>

<p>“I do not know that I will,” said Ray.</p>

<p>Howard looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“You mean to say that you—you—” then his face
clouded again as he continued—“still, after all what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
difference could that make to me? Only a few days.
You might as well do your worst.”</p>

<p>“Howard,” cried Ray, with determination, “I do
not say yet what I will do, but of one thing you may
be sure. I intend to have an explanation of this
strange behavior of yours. If you were simply a
common burglar I should turn you over to justice
without more ado; but you are not, you are a classmate
of mine, and, as such, your act is simply one of
madness. No student in his senses would attempt a
thing of this kind. I am convinced that it was a
desperate act on your part, and that you were driven to
it by some extraordinary cause. I am determined,
therefore, before going any further, to know your
reason for acting and talking in this strange manner.”</p>

<p>A curious expression came over Howard’s face as
Ray spoke. This evidence of interest in him on Ray’s
part was entirely unexpected by Howard, and wrought
quite a change in him. Like some hunted animal,
who has suddenly found a momentary resting place,
his nervousness and agitation diminished, his manner
became more composed, and his bitter tone gave way
to one of passive dejection. He leaned his head heavily
on his hands, and gazed despondently at the floor.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said in a voice that was scarcely
audible, “I was desperate. I would never have
stooped to this if a chance of retaining my reputation
was left. It was my last throw. Ruin is staring me
in the face!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Ruin!” exclaimed Ray. “Why, Howard, what
can you mean? What have you done?”</p>

<p>“Ruined myself—utterly—I don’t care what happens
now.”</p>

<p>A struggle was going on in Ray’s breast. His
face lost some of its severity.</p>

<p>“Tell me your whole story, Howard,” he said, in a
somewhat altered tone. “Why did you come in
here?”</p>

<p>“To steal—yes, give it the worst name—to steal.
It <em>was</em> an act of madness, but what else was there
for me to do? I had done almost everything else, and
exposure and disgrace stared me in the face,” and
Howard’s voice broke.</p>

<p>“Exposure! disgrace! For what?” asked Ray, in
great concern. “Come, speak out. Tell me all.”</p>

<p>Howard was silent a moment.</p>

<p>“I might as well speak,” he said at length, “for
everybody will know it soon.”</p>

<p>Ray and I remained silent, breathless and expectant,
while a death-like stillness settled upon the room.
After several minutes Howard roused himself slightly
and began:</p>

<p>“I can scarcely bear to think of it. It has been
growing a heavier weight on my mind for weeks past,
haunting me at night, destroying my sleep, and depriving
me of all peace, until to-day, when I could
stand it no longer, and was about to—but I will tell
you the whole story. My trouble really began away
back in Freshman year. You remember that wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Cuban, Rapello, in the Senior class at that time. You
remember his companion and roommate, Leisenring,
and the whole crowd with whom they went, and you
remember warning me against them as dangerous
company. I felt able to take care of myself, and, as
I was very much flattered by the attention of these
upper classmen, I went with them constantly, as you
know. You may not know, however, that a great deal
of card playing was done in their rooms, and always
for money. As my father is a clergyman, I was never
allowed to look at cards at home, so I first became
acquainted with the game in the company of those
fellows. I became fascinated with it, and naturally
too, for I was very fortunate, and won a great deal
of money during Freshman year. During Sophomore
year I was still more fortunate, and began to look
upon my luck as assured, and to play with boldness
and confidence. In Junior year the men whom I had
associated with had nearly all graduated; so my next
step was to form my room into a similar establishment
to that of Rapello and Leisenring’s, and to draw in
some of my companions and such of the under classmen
as I could influence.</p>

<p>“I worked very cautiously, and kept it very quiet,
but my room during Junior year was scarcely better
than a downright gambling den. Late into the nights
we played, with drawn curtains, and our stakes ran
even higher than had been known in the games of
Rapello and Leisenring. I always forced the play
boldly, taking pride in my reckless daring and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
luck that almost invariably attended it. A change,
however, came at last, and toward the end of Junior
year I began to suffer heavy reverses. The passion
for play had by this time taken thorough possession
of me, and I could not give up the game. My position
as the leader, moreover, made it doubly difficult
for me to retire, had I wanted to. At the beginning
of Senior year, when I returned to college, I had lost
all I had ever won.</p>

<p>“Thinking that my luck would turn, I began the
game again in my rooms. Only a few college students
rejoined me, for the stakes had grown high, so
I sought a few companions among some of the men
of the town. They were older than I, and had, as a
rule, considerable money. After a month or so the
game was transferred from my room—where it was
risky—to a place in town. Here my ill luck began
again, and all during the winter I continued to lose,
until I had nothing left. Then, still unable to give up
the game, and always hoping to recover my lost
ground, I began to play on borrowed money. This
continued until my credit was gone amongst my
friends, then I played for a while without money, paying
my losses in promissory notes.</p>

<p>“As I saw these notes coming due, and found myself
unable to meet them, I grew desperate, and
stooped to a number of half dishonest devices in order
to secure the cash needed. I can’t mention all these.
They made me feel ashamed at first, but necessity
forced me, and I soon became used to it. Things that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
had previously seemed mean and despicable to me, became
matters of indifference. I found myself excusing
acts that had always aroused my contempt. At
length I got down to cheating—I couldn’t help it.
I had to have money. I didn’t cheat in the games
with town men. I couldn’t do that—they were too
sharp for me; but I would play smaller games with
under classmen and win money by unfair practices.
In doing this I was very careful, and was never suspected.
Those from whom I have obtained money in
this way are good friends, and have never supposed
me guilty of dishonorable dealing. But it weighed
on me and destroyed my peace of mind. I was always
uneasy and in fear of being detected, so I looked
about me for other means of obtaining money.</p>

<p>“It was then that tennis occurred to me. I began
to bet on my playing, not in small sums—I had
done that often before—but heavily. Some one
dared me to play you, saying that you could beat me.
I made a bet of twenty-five dollars on the result, and
invited you to play me. That bet I lost, as you know,
and you refused to give me an opportunity of recovering
that loss. At that time I was specially hard
pressed for money, and ready to do almost anything
to secure it. Suddenly an idea occurred to me that
seemed to promise well. If I could interest the college
in contributing to lawn tennis I might make use
of the money appropriated for this purpose, and obtain
temporary relief from the debts that were pressing
me so hard. I did not contemplate actually stealing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the money. I only wanted to gain time until I
could raise more money in some other quarter.</p>

<p>“I had it all arranged that I should be nominated
for treasurer in case the college took up with my idea,
and I would have no difficulty in being elected, as I
had always been so prominent in tennis. I took advantage
of the fact that baseball stock seemed low, and
tried to draw the college toward tennis. You know
how my effort failed, but you do not know how desperate
that failure made me. I was angry with
everybody, especially with you, whom I believed to
be chiefly to blame—you see I don’t mind telling all
this. I can do myself no harm now.”</p>

<p>“But Howard,” cried Ray aghast, “could even that
bring you to such an act as this? Could——”</p>

<p>“No. The worst is to come. That only made me
angry, and it was because I was angry with you that
I intercepted your letter about the baseball meeting.
It was merely to get square with you. It was mean
and small, I know, but it isn’t the worst I have done.</p>

<p>“Of course I was compelled to carry my debts for
a while longer, and as this was becoming more and
more difficult on account of the growing impatience
of my creditors, I was at my wits’ end to know what
to do. Some notes had come due, others were impending,
and the men—who had been friendly enough
at the start—refused to extend the time, and threatened
to force me to payment. Of course I did not
fear legal prosecution for a debt contracted at cards,
but I dreaded exposure, and the disgrace that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
follow. So it continued until last Wednesday night.</p>

<p>“It was then that I cast all caution to the winds,
and determined to make a bold move at cards. I
had not been playing lately, for I had no money, and
the others had refused to trust me for any further
amounts. But Wednesday night I received a little
money from home and I went to the usual place. I
feared that they would keep me from the game on account
of my unpaid debts, so I told them that I had
only fifteen dollars, and as they seemed to be in a
good humor they let me in, each of my creditors, I
suppose hoping that I would win enough to pay off
his claim. I was reckless of consequences, and had
come to win by any means fair or unfair. As I might
have supposed, in such an experienced crowd, I was
detected before I had cheated half a dozen times, and
then a terrible storm arose. I thought I would be
torn to pieces. They rose in a body, calling me a
swindler and blackleg, and put me out of the place.
Before leaving they dictated the terms of payment
of the money I owed them. They told me that unless
the notes that were due were paid by Saturday
they would expose me to the town and faculty and so
ruin my character as well as my chances of graduation.</p>

<p>“I knew not where to turn. My first impulse was
to run away, anywhere, so as to be free from the
terrible burden that was growing on me. Every resource
had been exhausted, and exposure and disgrace
awaited me. Oh, such a night of agony as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
passed! I lay awake, racking my brain for some
method of escape. Suddenly I thought of Professor
Fuller. It was humiliating to think of visiting him
on such an errand, but I knew that I must obtain
money somewhere, and that he had been kind to the
boys, so I resolved to call on him. I did so the next
morning. I did not tell him the story, but said I owed
money to tradesmen in town, that they were pressing
me hard and threatened trouble, that I didn’t want
to ask my father at once for more money, as I had just
received some from home; and I solicited his help for
a short time. The more pressing debts amounted to
$100, and this sum he lent me.</p>

<p>“This was Thursday, and I was going to pay the
four notes that were due at once, when it suddenly
occurred to me that Saturday’s game with Dean College
might win me some more money if I could get
several bets. Accordingly I saved the money, and
took it over to Dean. I succeeded in staking it all,
and I felt confident of the result, for we had never
been beaten by Dean. To my amazement we lost the
game, and my case was utterly hopeless. Every cent
was gone, and I had no means of gaining more.</p>

<p>“Every resource had been exhausted, and I had
only to wait for the crash that was sure to come. I
was dazed and benumbed at the prospect. There
was nothing for me to do. Every vestige of hope
had left me. I was simply ruined. When I came
back I started for my room with no special purpose
in mind, when I saw your door ajar. As I told you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Ridley was in the hall. He was filling your pitcher
at the back of the building and did not see me. I
scarcely knew why I came in. When Ridley closed the
door, I began to look about. I did not expect your
return, for I supposed you were still living in town.
I took my time, therefore, and was examining the
contents of your desk when I heard you in the hall.”</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Howard paused and looked up at Ray with a dazed,
hopeless expression of face. Neither Ray nor I spoke
a word for several minutes. We had listened to
Howard’s narrative with mingled feelings of horror
and pity. Neither of us had known him except as a
college mate; and while we had never been attracted
to him, we had not, until recently, found any cause
to dislike him. We knew him to be one of a fast
crowd, and had always avoided a chance of close companionship.
Of his gambling proclivities we had
known a little and suspected more.</p>

<p>Rumors had reached us of the card playing that
was carried on in his room during Junior year; but
we had supposed that this was broken up, and knew
nothing of his joining a crowd of town men. His
confession was therefore a terrible shock to us, revealing
as it did a far greater familiarity with vicious
habits than we ever suspected him of, and showing
to what depths he had sunk. We could scarcely believe
our ears, and only the convicting circumstances
under which we had found him in Ray’s room made
the story credible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>Ray was looking at him fixedly, his face clearly indicating
the strange feelings that filled his breast.</p>

<p>“But, Howard,” he said at length, “I am still unable
to understand this last act of yours. Your case
is desperate, I own, but what could have brought you
in here? To steal, you say. Yet, it is hard to believe
that you have sunk so low.”</p>

<p>“Understand it! Of course you can’t understand
it,” burst out Howard. “You must go through all
that I have to understand it. You must yield first to
one temptation and then to another, and so on down,
down, down, till there seems to be nothing left to stand
on; till you have lost all pride, all self respect, and
care for nothing, till you are perfectly hopeless, and
ruin and wretchedness stare you in the face; till you
tremble instinctively at every footstep, fearing that
exposure is on your track, till everybody seems to
point you out as a guilty, contemptible wretch, and
you grow reckless, desperate, and don’t care where
you go or what you do; then, then you will understand
this mad act, and then you will understand what
I feel now.”</p>

<p>“Howard,” cried Ray, his voice trembling with
feeling, “don’t speak so. It is terrible.”</p>

<p>“It is only the truth,” answered Howard, his tone
resuming its former key of despondency. “When
I came in here I was half dazed, and scarcely knew
what I was doing. I had some vague idea of getting
money or valuables some way, and averting the crash
for a while. When I saw your door open I remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
that you had handsome rooms and many costly
things, and before I could think twice I was in.
Driven to extremes as I was, I did not reason the
matter, but began searching for money or something
that would bring money. Oh, don’t try to shame me
by calling it bad names! It isn’t necessary. With all
that I have done, I felt that I was a wretched, despicable
criminal every minute that I went about plundering
your things. As it is I’m glad—yes, I’m glad
I’m caught. It is all over with me, and it serves me
right.”</p>

<p>Howard’s words cut me keenly. Such utter
wretchedness I had never witnessed. His voice was
broken, his eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the struggle in Ray’s
bosom, it was plainly over now. He rose, and stepped
forward to where Howard was sitting. The latter
did not look up.</p>

<p>“Howard,” Ray said firmly, “you have sunk low—very
low, indeed. You have reached the bottom.
Do you suppose you could ever build yourself up
again?”</p>

<p>Howard looked up in wonder at the question.</p>

<p>“Build myself up? No. I’ll never have the
chance. I’m down, and I have no such hope.”</p>

<p>“But when you had a chance,” continued Ray,
“before it was too late, did you never think about
yourself, and see where you were going?”</p>

<p>“Not until I was going too fast to stop,” answered
Howard despondently. “Then I thought—oh, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
many nights I spent thinking, thinking, thinking!
Longing to have a clean record and a fresh start!
Oh, I can look back now, easy enough, and say what
I would do if I had a chance—but it is useless. Here
I am helpless—everlastingly disgraced. And then
there is my father, poor old man. He would gladly
help me, but he can’t. He has sent me all the money
he had. He couldn’t afford to send me more, and it
will—yes, I know it will nearly kill him to know the
truth. Oh, I wish I could die!”</p>

<p>Howard, with a cry fell forward on his knees, buried
his face in his hands, and burst into a wild fit of weeping.</p>

<p>Howard’s emotion stirred me deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ray!” I exclaimed. “This is terrible.”</p>

<p>Ray did not seem to hear me. He leaned forward
and placed his hand on Howard’s shoulder. His face
was pale and quiet.</p>

<p>“Howard,” he said in a low tone, “I am in earnest
when I ask you my question. Would you profit by a
chance if it were offered you? I mean, would you
profit by your hard experience and make a man of
yourself if you had the opportunity?”</p>

<p>Howard stopped instantly, and remained breathless
for several seconds. He scarce dared believe all
that Ray’s words implied.</p>

<p>“Would I profit by it?” he cried, “Yes, yes, yes.
If I only had a chance to prove it! Oh, the vows
that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“I want no vows,” interrupted Ray, speaking
quickly. “Your promise is enough.”</p>

<p>Howard looked up, an expression of yearning in his
face. Scarcely hoping, yet longing to find encouragement
in Ray’s words, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, Wendell—Ray—Ray—you mean to
say——”</p>

<p>“That you shall have a chance, Howard,” answered
Ray firmly. “I will trust you, and pay your debts,
and you are to try to make a man of yourself.”</p>

<p>Howard uttered a quick, inarticulate cry, and sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>“First calm yourself,” said Ray, “and sit down
on the sofa there.”</p>

<p>Howard passively obeyed him.</p>

<p>“Now tell me how much you owe altogether.”</p>

<p>“Nearly eight hundred dollars,” answered Howard
slowly.</p>

<p>“And one hundred must be paid at once?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to-night.”</p>

<p>“And the payment of these debts will set you on
your feet again, and give you a fresh start?”</p>

<p>“Yes—all but those town fellows. They know
that I cheated.”</p>

<p>“The money will quiet them, I think,” answered
Ray. “Now, listen to me, Howard. Your case is
not so desperate. Your debts need only to be paid
to secure your reputation, and then you can face the
world honestly. I will pay these——first of all this
hundred dollars. I have somewhat over that amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
in the National Bank, and I will give you a check
at once. This you can take this evening to those
men and shut their mouths. Now as to those other
debts——”</p>

<p>Here Ray started toward his desk, recollected himself,
turned toward Howard and said as gently as
possible:</p>

<p>“Howard, kindly tell me where you put my bank
book.”</p>

<p>Howard turned scarlet as he tremblingly took Ray’s
bank book from his pocket.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I took it,” he said in a shame
faced manner. “I could never have used it.”</p>

<p>Ray received it without a word, opened it, and examined
the columns of figures.</p>

<p>“There are two hundred and ten dollars to my
credit in the bank,” he said, “and I can get more
from my father when it is needed. Monday morning
you must pay back Professor Fuller first of all.
The other debts I will meet as they come due. Now
I must give you that check.”</p>

<p>Ray drew a chair up to the desk, and opening a
small drawer, took out a check book, and settled himself
to write.</p>

<p>Until now Howard had accepted the situation while
hardly able to comprehend it. It seemed to be too
good to be true, and yet Ray’s cool and decided manner
carried assurance beyond doubt. Such unexpected
generosity from one whom he had regarded as an
enemy was a revelation to him, and it was beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
to work in him just the change that Ray desired.
He sat silent and thoughtful while Ray wrote.</p>

<p>I moved forward, and, bending over Ray’s shoulder,
said:</p>

<p>“If I can help you out, Ray, I have some savings
which I should be glad to put in.”</p>

<p>Ray looked up a moment, and answered in a tone
too low for Howard to hear:</p>

<p>“Thanks, Harry, but I think it would be better
to do it all up by myself. You know what I mean.
He would feel like a beggar if two or three contributed.
Better let me finish it.”</p>

<p>At this moment Howard looked up.</p>

<p>“Wendell,” he began, “why do you take this heavy
risk? You know nothing but bad of me——”</p>

<p>“Because I expect to know nothing but good of
you hereafter,” answered Ray promptly. “I have
your promise, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” responded Howard fervently.
“But how can I ever repay the loan? I can never
rest until it is paid up to you, and you know I am not
wealthy.”</p>

<p>“Take your time. I can trust you,” answered
Ray. “There is your check, now, so you must hurry
off and get rid of your tormentors. The others we
can attend to later. There is no one else knows anything
of this?”</p>

<p>“No one,” answered Howard, “except perhaps
Jarvis down stairs. He may not understand about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the disturbance of your desk. You know you spoke
to him about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I did,” said Ray. “Never mind, I will
see him and tell him that it is all right. I will explain
the matter satisfactorily. Now you’d better
hurry, for it is getting late.”</p>

<p>Howard started toward the door. After two or
three steps he turned hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Wendell—Ray—would you mind shaking hands
with me?” he asked.</p>

<p>Ray extended his hand immediately. Howard
seized it convulsively with both of his, while his whole
frame quivered, and tears started to his eyes afresh.
It was but a moment, and then Howard turned to go
away. He had already reached the door when something
seemed to occur to him, and he wheeled about
and came back.</p>

<p>“Ray,” he said, “there is something else I must
tell you. You remember the night we brought the
cannons back from Berkeley. It was I that borrowed
your match box that night, and I dropped it by the
cannon on purpose.”</p>

<p>Howard paused.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” answered Ray quietly, “or at least,
felt quite sure of it. Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you ought to know it, that was
all,” answered Howard. Then without another word
he passed out of the door.</p>

<p>Ray stood looking after him thoughtfully. I came
up and touched him on the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Ray,” said I, “you are a splendid fellow.”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he answered. “I only did what I
think is a fellow’s duty. Howard will never forget
to-night. He will keep his promise. Just wait and
see.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<small>RENEWED HOPES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ray Wendell was right when he said that I exaggerated
the effect that our defeat would have upon
our college mates. They were surprised and disappointed,
it is true—bitterly disappointed, for they
had shared our confidence in the nine; but fortunately
we had numerous witnesses in the omnibus load of
companions who accompanied us, and who knew well
enough where the trouble lay, and what had caused
our defeat. To these witnesses I soon felt a genuine
debt of gratitude, for it speedily became evident that
the reports which they brought back from the game
were as charitable to the team as could possibly be expected
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The greetings which we received were kind and considerate.
Fellows took pains to make us feel the
humiliation as little as possible. Early Monday morning
I met Clinton Edwards, and his first words, as
he shook hands with me, were, “Harry, you played a
fine game—steady and true right through to the
end. I am very sorry you had such hard luck. It
was no fault of yours, nor the others in fact, except
Fred Harrison, that we didn’t win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>And this was the general expression of feeling on
every hand, no one showing the least disposition to
find fault with the team, but all ready to attribute the
result to ill fortune, and to extend their sympathy.
Even poor Fred Harrison came in for as much pity
as condemnation for his foolish act.</p>

<p>The disposition on the part of the college put new
spirit into us, and renewed our purpose to go in and
regain our lost ground. That we could entirely recover
ourselves and win the Crimson Banner of course
seemed next to impossible, but we pinned our hope
to the game with the Park men. Should we be able
to defeat them, we would feel largely compensated
even for the loss of the championship. I shared Ray’s
opinion that our chances of defeating Park College
were very fair, for I felt confident that our team in
its altered form, with Percy Randall on third base,
would do fine work, and such rumors as had come
from Berkeley had not reported very favorably on the
Park nine.</p>

<p>I did not, however, rely too much on these rumors,
for it had been a favorite dodge of the Park men
to start reports of their condition, in order to deceive
and mislead their opponents. Of the truth concerning
their nine we could learn more after the following
Wednesday, when the Park and the Halford teams
played together. Ray Wendell determined to go over
to see this game in order to obtain points that it
might be to our advantage to know. I could not
accompany him, for I had a recitation on that day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
but Clinton Edwards agreed to go over, and upon
his and Ray’s experienced judgment we could rely for
a proper estimate of the abilities of our opponents.</p>

<p>Fred Harrison improved rapidly, but was compelled
to carry his arm in a sling for some time, and was
forbidden by the doctor to play ball again during the
spring, so that Ray was relieved of all difficulty in
disposing of him. Fred was heartily ashamed of himself,
and for a long time after the game could not
bear to speak of the matter. The fellows, knowing
well how mortified and humiliated he was, were careful
to treat him with as much consideration as possible,
and no thoughtless or unkind word from them
ever reminded him of that unfortunate day at Dean.</p>

<p>What brought mortification to Fred, however, made
Percy Randall happy. The latter had been disappointed
in missing a position on the nine in the first
place, and the change which unexpectedly brought
him a place delighted him.</p>

<p>The hope of improvement which Ray had expressed
became confirmed in me the moment I saw Percy
step out on the diamond Monday noon. He had received
his notification during the morning, and came
down to the grounds with a smiling face and an air
of pride. It had certainly paid us to encourage him,
for the way he took hold of balls, and the dash and
vim with which he played, convinced me that we had
nothing to fear from that quarter. As I watched
him, I could only wonder that we had not seen the
stuff that was in him before. As we anticipated, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
his spirit was contagious, and all the fellows played
with a dash that was remarkable for a team who had
just returned from a humiliating defeat.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Tony Larcom, as he stood
beside me while I was batting the ball to the various
basemen. “Percy Randall is a regular tonic. If the
fellows will keep in this form they can beat the earth.
Good boy, Percy! That was a dandy,” he added, as
our new third baseman made a dive towards short stop
and captured a hard ground hit with one hand. I
nodded in approbation to Ray, who wore a smile of
confidence as he stood watching this play from second
base.</p>

<p>At the close of our practice, Ray, Tony, and I
walked back to the college together.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, boys,” said Tony, “and we will see
that Crimson Banner yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ray, with a laugh, “I can see it
Wednesday when I go over to Berkeley. It doesn’t
cost anything to see it, but I fancy we may be able to
capture it, too, if we can keep on in the way we have
begun to-day. We are still a little unaccustomed to
the change, but I think we will soon get used to it.
The only thing I could wish for is more time to practice.
Our game with Park College comes off next
Saturday. That is just a week too soon for me. If
we could have six days’ more practice, I shouldn’t
be afraid to tackle the best college nine in the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right as it is,” answered Tony. “We’ll
be in good condition by Saturday, don’t you fear.”</p>

<p>“I can tell better about our prospects after I see
Wednesday’s game,” said Ray. “At any rate we will
practice twice a day until Thursday, so we ought to be
in good trim. Don’t forget to be on hand at five
o’clock this afternoon,” he added as I left him.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant experience to Ray and myself to
be walking freely upon the campus again and attending
our lectures. We had neither of us lost ground,
but were enabled to resume our places without suffering
any disadvantage from our period of suspension.
This was of course due entirely to the care with which
we had attended to our studies while lodging in town;
and the knowledge of this did much to conciliate Dr.
Drayton, who greeted us both kindly, and even unbent
so far as to express his sympathy with us in our defeat—or
to put it in his highly dignified way, he “regretted
that our efforts in the baseball field had not
been so far attended with success.”</p>

<p>Professor Fuller I had not seen during Monday or
Tuesday, but after visiting the post office Tuesday
evening, I determined to take advantage of the next
hour’s leisure and pay the professor a short call. As
I turned from the main street into the lane which
led to Professor Fuller’s house I heard a light footstep
behind me, and turned quickly to see who it was.
The sun had only just set, and the light was still sufficient
for me to see it was Miss Nettie who was approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
probably, like myself, returning from the
post office. I stopped and greeted her.</p>

<p>“I am going your way,” I said. “May I accompany
you?”</p>

<p>She nodded pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to see the ‘Old Governor’?” she
asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “Do you call him
by that name, too?”</p>

<p>“I might almost as well,” she said frankly. “It
seems to suit father so well, and I think he likes it,
too. He is at home—at least he was a half hour ago
when I left him after supper. It was only this afternoon
that we were talking about you and Mr. Wendell
and the ball nine. In fact, I haven’t talked about anything
else for the past two days.”</p>

<p>“We were in very hard luck,” I said.</p>

<p>“Indeed you were,” she said warmly. “I can’t get
over it. I asked everybody I knew about it, and got
all the accounts I could. You know it is very hard
for me to get the news, having no brother to tell me,
but I made up my mind I would know all about it,
and I did. I was sure it couldn’t be your fault that
the game was lost. I didn’t believe anybody could
beat our nine. It was too bad about Mr. Harrison——”</p>

<p>“About Harrison?” I said quickly, wondering who
could have told her the whole truth about Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, about his being taken sick,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I said, somewhat relieved to find that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
actual truth had not reached her. “Yes, it was too
bad. It happened just at the wrong time for us.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how sorry I am,” she went on,
“for I had counted on our winning that game. I
am glad it didn’t take place here, for I couldn’t have
stood the sight of it. I know I should have cried.
I always do when I get terribly excited, and I make
a perfect sight of myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, we appreciate your feelings, anyhow, Miss
Nettie,” I answered with a laugh, “and I wish we
had proved ourselves worthy of your sympathy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will do better next time, I’m sure; and
I think I would rather see you beat Park College than
get the championship.”</p>

<p>“That is the way I feel,” I said; “and if we can
beat both Halford and Park Colleges we can still tie
for championship, so all hope is not gone yet of
reaching the Crimson Banner.”</p>

<p>We had now arrived at Professor Fuller’s house.</p>

<p>“If you will wait one moment I will see if father
is in,” said Miss Nettie, hurrying into the house.
In a short time she returned.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” she said. “Father is engaged
with some one in the library. The door is closed,
and I cannot tell who it is, but from the voice I think
it must be one of the students. Won’t you wait? He
may be at leisure shortly.”</p>

<p>“I have some work to do,” I answered, “so I’ll
not wait. My errand was not urgent, so I can call
again. I came merely for a brief social visit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“He will be sorry to miss you, I know,” said Miss
Nettie, “and you must come again soon.”</p>

<p>“I will, thank you,” was my response. “Good
night, Miss Nettie.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” she responded; “and tell Mr. Wendell
that we are sorry the game came out so badly.”</p>

<small>A TURN OF LUCK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I had not retraced my footsteps far when I heard
Professor Fuller’s gate open and close. Evidently the
caller had taken his departure, and from the manner
in which he was following me, I felt confident he
must be one of the students. He was walking at
about the same pace that I was, keeping some fifty
yards behind me. At the entrance to the college
grounds I paused long enough for him to come up.</p>

<p>It was Len Howard. He either did not see me,
or did not want to notice me, for he was going past me
with his head bent toward the ground.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Howard,” I said.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly. His face was somewhat pale
and worn; his expression grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Elder,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You were Professor Fuller’s visitor, weren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have just come from there. I am glad I
went. The old governor is very kind.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been telling him——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered Howard, interrupting me.
“It was not necessary to tell him everything. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
would only have distressed him, and—and I couldn’t
have gone all over it again. I went to pay him the
money I had borrowed, and which Ray gave me this
morning. I then merely told him that I had got foolishly
into debt, and asked his advice.”</p>

<p>“Have you disposed of those town men?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a terrible load it lifted off my mind. I
have done a lot of hard thinking during the past two
days, more than I ever did in my life before, and I
have made resolutions that I shall never break.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it, Howard,” I answered, “and I am
very glad you got out of your trouble so well.”</p>

<p>“What worries me most,” he continued, “is the
debt I owe Ray Wendell. As each of my debts is
paid I feel this load grow heavier; and while it is a
great relief to be rid of these old accounts, I hate to
think of all I owe to Ray. I would give anything to
be able to pay him promptly, but I don’t know what
to do. I am in very moderate circumstances, and my
debts amount to a large sum.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it worry you, Howard,” I answered.
“I know you will do your best, and so does Ray.
Pay him as you feel you can.”</p>

<p>“It was about this particularly that I wanted Professor
Fuller’s advice. I told him I was willing to
do almost anything to secure the money I needed, and
he made a suggestion which I am going to follow out,
and which I hope will bring good results.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope so,” I answered, as we parted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>I was walking toward Colver Hall, thinking over
this conversation, and scarcely noticing my surroundings,
when my foot suddenly tripped over a large
drain pipe which lay on the grass, and which I had
not seen on account of the darkness. I was thrown
violently to the ground, my right wrist doubling under
me in such a way as to give it a severe wrench. It
pained me considerably for a few minutes, so on
reaching my room I bathed it freely with liniment until
the pain subsided. Finding that it gave me little
more trouble, and, beyond some slight aching, seemed
as strong as usual, I experienced a feeling of relief
at having escaped so luckily, and soon ceased thinking
about it.</p>

<p>But the next morning my wrist was brought to
my attention again. I was alarmed to find that it
had swollen during the night, and was stiff and unmanageable.
As I could move it only slightly, and
then with considerable pain, the idea of using it for
my regular exercise in pitching was out of the question.
This worried me, so hurrying over to the doctor’s
the first thing after breakfast, I submitted my
wrist to his examination.</p>

<p>The doctor felt of the injured spot carefully.</p>

<p>“Only a slight straining of the muscles and tendons,”
he said. “It will be all right in a week.”</p>

<p>“A week!” I exclaimed. “Why, I must pitch a
game of ball this Saturday.”</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, you may be able to use it a little by that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
time if you rest it until then, but I shouldn’t advise
you to subject it to such violent exercise. You probably
cannot last out a whole game, and you would
only strain it worse, so that it would be laid up for
several weeks. Now, if you can wait a few days
longer, you will have no trouble.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t,” I said in despair; “the game must
take place Saturday, and I <em>must</em> pitch.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could give you more encouragement,”
said the doctor. “You take considerable risk in trying
to pitch a whole game through so soon after injuring
it. I can recommend an excellent liniment,
and perhaps it may bring you into some sort of shape
by Saturday, but I fear not.”</p>

<p>I took the doctor’s prescription, and went away
very much discouraged by his words. What were we
to do? The nine had no substitute pitcher, and depended
solely upon me. If I found myself unable to
play, all the rest would feel the evil effects of the
loss, and the result would probably be another defeat—and
this time by Park College! Oh, it was too
much! I set my teeth, and determined that I would
pitch if it broke my arm to do it.</p>

<p>I concluded to say nothing about the matter to any
of the other fellows except Ray, knowing that it
would only have a discouraging effect upon them; so
when twelve o’clock came I went down to the
grounds, and occupied myself in coaching the others
instead of pitching. This appeared perfectly natural
to the rest, for Ray had left on the noon train for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
Berkeley to witness the Park-Halford game, and I
had always acted as captain in his absence.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock that evening Tony and I went
down to the depot, and met Ray and Clinton Edwards
on their return from the game. They were
talking earnestly as they came towards us, and I fancied
that they both wore a hopeful expression of face.</p>

<p>“Who beat?” cried Tony, eager to learn the news.</p>

<p>“Oh, Park College, of course,” answered Edwards.
“They nearly always do on their own grounds.”</p>

<p>“What was the score?” I asked, as we turned back
towards the college.</p>

<p>“Five to three,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Why, that was pretty close. Was it a good
game?”</p>

<p>“Yes, fair; and the Park men only won by shouting
Halford out of the game. It was one of the
meanest games, as far as Park College is concerned,
that I ever saw. I honestly believe the Halford men
might have beaten on neutral grounds, but the mob
made such a racket that they couldn’t help making
a few errors, and those errors cost them the game.”</p>

<p>“Then the teams were evenly matched?”</p>

<p>“Very, and for a while it was simply a toss up
as to which would win. Boys, Halford has a pretty
good nine this year.”</p>

<p>“How about Park?”</p>

<p>“Not so good as usual—in most respects not a
bit better than the Halford team. If we can beat
one of them we can beat the other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“And what do you think of our chances now?”
I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Extremely good. I don’t think either of those
nines are as good as the team that we can put in the
field Saturday.”</p>

<p>Saturday! I had almost forgotten about my wrist,
and the word suddenly brought back the recollection
of my misfortune. I was reluctant to cast any cloud
over the hopeful spirits of my companions, but I knew
it had to come; so as soon as we reached Ray’s room
I told him what had happened. I tried not to exaggerate
it, and repeated the doctor’s very words, that
they might know exactly what to expect. Their faces
grew very serious at once. Ray examined my wrist
anxiously, then bit his lip with annoyance.</p>

<p>“Well, in all my life,” he exclaimed, “I never ran
up against such a succession of unlucky circumstances.
It certainly seems as if everything was conspiring to
destroy our chances.”</p>

<p>I tried to be as hopeful as possible.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may improve in a day or so. I intend
to exercise it, gently at first, and then harder, so
as to limber it up. I tell you one thing, boys, I
am going to play under any circumstances. All I
fear is that my wrist will be weak and injure my
work.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we have the game postponed?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered Ray. “The Park men
would never consent to it. If they got any wind of
the truth they would insist on having the game, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
one disabled man is not a sufficient excuse for postponement.
They would simply laugh at us for proposing
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Then I am going to pray for rain,” said Tony
so solemnly that we could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, Harry, we must make the best of it,” said
Ray. “Use your liniment and exercise your wrist
as much as you can without hurting it. It may come
out better than we think. I will get Raymond, the
Freshman pitcher, out to-morrow, so as to have him
ready and in some sort of condition by Saturday. Do
the other fellows know about it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, they might better know to-morrow than later,”
said Ray. “It would only discourage them to
tell them at the last moment. We must make up
our minds to accept the circumstances, and make as
good a fight as we can.”</p>

<p>During the next two days my wrist improved perceptibly,
but far too slowly for our plans; and as
Friday night approached, I was compelled to face the
fact that I would be able to pitch but a very weak
game the next day.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday had been days of anxiety and
suspense to me, constantly alternating, as I was, between
hope and discouragement; and when Friday
evening came, and I found my wrist still stiff and
weak, I was almost ready to cry with vexation. To
Ray’s inquiries I made as encouraging responses as
possible; but while I spoke of pitching the next day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
I knew in my heart that my efforts would prove
scarcely more than a dead weight on the rest of the
team, and I feared the results would only be disastrous.
My hopes of our winning the championship,
or of even making a respectable record, seemed to
have taken their departure; and it was with sadly depressed
spirits that I went to bed Friday evening, and
tried to get the long night’s rest which was needed
to refresh us for the next day’s struggle.</p>

<p>From a heavy dreamless sleep I was suddenly
awakened by the sound of someone hammering upon
my door. I sat up in a dazed state, wondering who
could be disturbing me at such an hour. My curtains
were drawn, and I had no means of knowing
what time it was, but I seemed to have slept but a
short while, and I fancied it could scarcely be more
than midnight. Meanwhile the hammering grew
more vociferous, and I heard a voice, which seemed
familiar, shouting outside:</p>

<p>“Harry; Harry Elder! Get up and come here
quick! I’ve got great news for you.”</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed and hurried to the door. There
in the hall stood Tony Larcom, waving an umbrella
excitedly over his head. From the window in the
entry the murky light of a cloudy day struggled in.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I asked in amazement,
laughing at the ridiculous sight he presented.</p>

<p>“Matter, my boy! Everything’s the matter! I
was up at daybreak, and hurried into my clothes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
run over here and tell you the good news. We are
saved—we are saved, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“Saved? Why, what do you mean?” I exclaimed,
still more mystified.</p>

<p>“Rain! rain!” he shouted, waving his umbrella
again. “Our luck has turned. It is raining pitchforks!
No game to-day.”</p>

<p>I rushed to the window, hardly daring to believe
his words. One glance was enough, and then I gave
a whoop of joy. The sky was darkly overcast, and
the rain was falling softly but steadily—not in a
shower, that might pass away in a few hours, but
with the heavy, businesslike downpour of a regular
easterly storm.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say that I was going to pray for rain?”
said Tony complacently, taking the credit of it all to
himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<small>THE SECOND GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Certainly, as Tony said, our luck had turned. As
the morning advanced, the rain continued to fall,
so the question of playing ball was practically settled.
About ten o’clock Tony telegraphed to the secretary
of the Park nine, “Raining hard. Shall we come?”
Within an hour he received the following answer from
Berkeley, “Impossible to play. Game will have to be
postponed. Will write you later.”</p>

<p>Mutual congratulations followed. The fellows
were all delighted, and at noon a jubilant, happy
crowd assembled in Ray’s room to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>“Nothing could have pleased me better,” said Ray.
“For the first time in my life I am glad to see it rain
on a baseball day. It gives Harry time to cure his
wrist, and the rest of us several days more of practice.
It is just what we most needed.”</p>

<p>“Pour away, old boy!” exclaimed Tony, as a sudden
gust of wind brought the rain swirling against
the window panes. “You have done the square
thing by us to-day. I’ll never complain of the
weather again—never. Say, Ray, what new date
had we better arrange for the game?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“I was just thinking of that,” answered Ray.
“We can’t get a day off in the middle of the week.
The faculty don’t want us to go away except on Saturdays.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we appoint the Monday following the
Halford game,” I said. “The faculty might object to
our going away twice. Now, as the Halford game
takes place next Saturday, we might stay at Halford
over Sunday, and play the Park men Monday afternoon,
on our way back. In that way we can do it all
up in one trip, and be back here Monday night.”</p>

<p>“A very good idea,” answered Ray, “and if the
Park men are agreeable, we had better fix it that way
by all means.”</p>

<p>The consent of our faculty to this scheme was easily
obtained, and the correspondence which Tony held
with the Park men resulted in their acceptance of the
arrangement, so the game was appointed to take place
on the Monday following our trip to Halford.</p>

<p>The marked improvement in uniformity and excellence
of play on the part of our nine during the
next week confirmed Ray’s statement that all we
needed to perfect ourselves was a few days’ more
practice. My wrist give me little trouble in the early
part of the week, so Wednesday morning I made the
experiment of pitching a whole practice game through
and found that I suffered nothing in consequence.
Thursday and Friday, therefore, I took my regular
practice with the others, and in proportion as my wrist
recovered strength I recovered confidence. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
these last two days I do not think any one would have
known that I had suffered any injury. My enforced
rest seemed, if anything, to have done me good, for
Friday I certainly felt more in the spirit of the game,
and pitched more effectively, than I had done before
I hurt my wrist.</p>

<p>“You needn’t come down this afternoon, fellows,”
said Ray, as we left the grounds at one o’clock.
“Keep quiet and remember to go to bed early to-night.”</p>

<p>We had arranged to leave the next morning on the
9:30 train, but I was up by seven o’clock anxious to
know what the weather had in store for us. To my
delight, I found on opening my curtains that fortune
again favored us, this time with bright sunshine and
an almost cloudless sky.</p>

<p>“It may be hot,” I thought, “but still what of that,
so long as it doesn’t rain.”</p>

<p>At the depot I found a large and interested crowd
of students who had assembled, as was their custom,
to see us off. The nine were all there, cheerful and in
good spirits, Tony Larcom rushing around like a
chicken with its head off, buying our tickets, checking
our luggage, and answering all sorts of questions
at the same time.</p>

<p>“At last!” he exclaimed as he caught sight of me,
and stopped a moment to mop the perspiration from
his face. “I was afraid you were going to be late.
Got your valise? Here give it to me, I’ll get it
checked. Jim; Jim! come here and get this valise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Hullo, Jim! Where in thunder is that fellow?—oh
there you are—get this checked right away and have
it ready with the other things. Cæsar’s ghost! but
isn’t it hot? Yes, Frank, I’ll telegraph the score immediately
after the game, don’t you fear. Here, you
fellows, get out of my way—how do you expect me
to do anything with a dozen or more crowding and
jamming——” and off he rushed while I joined the
other members of the nine.</p>

<p>In a few moments the train arrived and we quickly
clambered aboard, Tony making sure that we were all
there before he ascended the platform. Then, as the
train moved off, Tony waved his hat, while the crowd
at the station gave three rousing cheers, and with this
encouraging sound ringing in our ears, we set off for
Halford.</p>

<p>We expected to arrive there about eleven o’clock,
for Halford was not many miles beyond Berkeley.
Ray took advantage of this opportunity to say a few
final words of caution. During the week he had frequently
mentioned several points of weakness in the
Halford nine, and given us directions as to the best
manner of taking advantage of them. One point in
particular he had brought out strong, and this he
reiterated now.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he said, “the Halford men chiefly
lack nerve at critical junctures. They are apt to go
to pieces if pushed hard. They will play a strong
game while they are in the lead, and while they can
keep the bases clear; but heavy batting will demoralize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
them, and I think we can easily manage their pitcher.
We must try to fill the bases. We must hit the ball
<em>every time</em>. Don’t try to make home runs all the
time, but <em>hit the ball</em>, and run bases daringly. Take
every possible chance. We may lose one or two
points by so doing, but we will gain in the end, for it
will demoralize them, I know.”</p>

<p>When we arrived at Halford we found Slade and
Bennett, the secretary and captain of their nine, awaiting
us. The feeling between Halford and Belmont
Colleges had always been extremely friendly, and kept
up by succeeding generations with as much respect
for the tradition as had our bitter animosity for Park
College. Our reception, therefore, was of the pleasantest
nature possible.</p>

<p>“Very sorry to hear of your hard luck over at
Dean,” said Slade, as he shook hands with Ray and
me.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was too bad,” answered Ray, “but you
have had your share of misfortune too—last Wednesday,
I mean. I think you should have had that
game.”</p>

<p>“Well, so do we,” said Bennett, “but what could
we expect, playing as we did on their ground? We
had to play the nine and the whole crowd too. I fear
you will get your dose of it on Monday.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>Halford had received a donation from a wealthy
graduate of money enough to lay out new grounds
and construct a new and large grand stand. As we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
entered the gate in our carriages after dinner, the
sight that met our eyes was enough to gladden the
heart of any baseball enthusiast.</p>

<p>The new diamond was as level as a billiard table,
and covered with fresh, green, closely cropped grass,
while the grand stand was gaily decorated with flags,
and filled with a chattering and laughing crowd of
people.</p>

<p>“Great Scott,” exclaimed Percy Randall, “just
look at that outfield, boys! There isn’t a blade of
grass on it, and it is as smooth and hard as a board.
If we knock a hard ball outside of the diamond it
will roll into the middle of next week.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we want to do, fellows,” answered
Ray promptly. “Hit low and hard, and the
ball won’t stop this side of the fence. Remember now
for the last time, fellows: don’t hit up in the air—hit
hard and low, and run your bases like tigers.”</p>

<p>We were accorded the compliment of a round burst
of applause, as the Halford men came in from their
practice, and we ran out on the field. This put us in
the best of spirits, and we set to work picking up the
balls, catching them on the fly, and throwing them
from base to base with a brilliancy and dash that
elicited frequent acknowledgment from the grand
stand. We had only ten minutes for our preliminary
exercise; then the signal sounded, and the game was
called.</p>

<p>Now that fortune had turned, it persisted in our
favor, for we won the toss, and chose the field. Full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
of confidence we ran to our various positions, and
their first batter took his place.</p>

<p>Not being quite warmed to work yet, I made the
mistake of placing the first ball directly over the plate.
The batter caught it about the center of his bat, and
sent it away out to center field. It had not occurred
to us in our calculations that the outfield might prove
as advantageous to our opponents as to ourselves in
case they hit hard; but this was brought forcibly to
my mind, for, before the ball was captured on the
ground by Lewis Page, the batter reached second base.
This was greeted by a round of applause, but nothing
daunted, we settled down to work, and put out the
next man in short order.</p>

<p>Then came a hard ground hit to George Ives, who
threw the batter out at first base, but this enabled the
first batter to reach third. Then a safe hit was made
just over Ray Wendell’s head, and the runner on third
base scored. The next man I succeeded in striking
out, and we took the bat.</p>

<p>George Ives opened with a good safe hit, and according
to Ray Wendell’s direction, he dashed down
to second base at the first ball pitched. The catcher
hardly expected this, threw over the second baseman’s
head, and George reached third. The next two, Percy
Randall and myself, were thrown out at first base, and
it looked almost as if George Ives would be left on
third, but Holland saved us from this by hitting safe
and bringing George home. We made no more runs,
and the inning closed with the score 1–1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>In the second inning neither scored. In the third
inning Halford made one run, while we were blanked.
But in the fourth inning we returned the compliment
by making a run and blanking them. In the fifth
inning they made one more run, making the score
3–2 in their favor. In the sixth and seventh innings
they kept this lead, and prevented us from scoring.</p>

<p>In spite of their being ahead, we had felt no anxiety,
for we were sure of our superiority both in the
field and at the bat, and we believed that our time
would come. It was only at the end of the seventh
inning that we felt the least uneasy.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Ray, “this won’t do. We are nearing
the end of the game, and they are still in the lead.
We must break this up. You see, it is just as I told
you: they play a fine game while they keep the bases
clean. We haven’t pushed them hard enough. We
must set the ball rolling. Start her off, Alfred.”</p>

<p>His last words were addressed to Burnett, who was
first at the bat in the ending of the eighth inning.
But Alfred evidently did not see his way clear, for
he struck out.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, let me show you,” cried Percy Randall
cheerfully, as he took his position.</p>

<p>Percy was as good as his word, and at the second
ball pitched, placed it nicely over the short stop’s head,
reaching first base in safety. This was Percy’s first
chance and we immediately learned his value. He
followed Ray’s instructions by performing two successive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
feats of reckless base running such as I had
never in my life seen before.</p>

<p>At the very first ball he was off for second base.
The catcher threw straight and true, but Percy hurled
himself forward head first, and slid into the base
safely. Hastily picking himself up and without stopping
to dust himself off, he started off at the next ball,
and dashed for third base. Again the catcher threw
straight, but, by another brilliant slide, Percy reached
third.</p>

<p>This took the Halford men by storm. They had
never seen anything quite like Percy’s impudence,
and the success of it staggered them. I was at the
bat and waiting for a good ball, but the pitcher disconcerted
by Percy’s feat, gave me my base on balls.
At the next ball I ran down to second, the catcher not
daring to throw it down for fear of letting Percy
in home. Holland, who was at the bat, noticed that
the pitcher was unsettled, and coolly waited for two
strikes to be called. The pitcher continued to throw
wild, and, as a result, Holland was given his base on
balls.</p>

<p>This left us with a runner on each base, and only
one man out. Ray Wendell then came to the bat and
looked calmly at the situation.</p>

<p>“Now, Ray,” I said to myself, “you told <em>us</em> what
to do. Now show us <em>how</em>. Practice what you’ve
preached, my boy, and the day is saved.”</p>

<p>Ray planted himself firmly, and waited for a good
ball. The pitcher, knowing well that if he gave Ray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
also his base on balls, it would force us all around,
and bring Percy home, was careful to put the ball
straight over the plate.</p>

<p>“One strike,” called the umpire.</p>

<p>The pitcher hurled another ball almost exactly in
the same spot.</p>

<p>“Hit it! Hit it!” I exclaimed in a whisper.</p>

<p>Ray’s bat flashed in the air. <a href="#i_frontis">Crack! came a report
that sounded over the whole field.</a> The ball shot over
my head like lightning, about ten feet above the
ground, landing safely between left and center field,
and rolled on—on—on, while the two fielders ran
desperately after it, and Percy, I, Holland, and lastly,
Ray himself, dashed around in home, <em>making four
runs in all</em>.</p>

<p>We were wild with joy, the other fellows receiving
us with open arms. The grand stand greeted the
play with some applause, and, considering the loss it
brought to their friends in the field, we appreciated
greatly their generosity. Ray’s hit was a long and
hard one, and he could almost have walked around
before the fielders reached the ball.</p>

<p>“Go around again, Ray!” shouted Tony, entirely
forgetting the dignity of his position as our scorer,
in the delight of the moment.</p>

<p>We made no more runs that inning, the Halford
men settling down bravely to steady playing as they
found the bases clear again. The game was practically
settled, however, for the score was now 6–3
in our favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>Confidently we took the field for the ninth inning,
and played a strong, sure game which resulted in our
closing the Halford men out without a run. With
evident signs of disappointment the large crowd dispersed,
and we found ourselves a jolly set of victors.
We gathered together and gave three cheers for the
Halford men, which were responded to by a similar
compliment from their nine, and then hurried to our
carriages. Laughing, shouting, and joking, we
scrambled in.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Percy, as he tumbled in a heap
over me. “Who says we can’t play ball?”</p>

<p>The driver wheeled his team about and we were
off for our hotel.</p>

<p>“And now, boys,” said Ray, his face glowing with
excitement and pleasure—“Now for Park College,
and the Crimson Banner!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br>
<small>GENEROUS HOSTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>An hour later and a jubilant, noisy crowd of students
were seated about one of the large tables in the
dining room of the Halford House, all bent upon
doing justice to the best dinner that the modest hostelry
could supply. The party lacked only one thing
to complete its happiness—the presence of Tony Larcom.</p>

<p>“Where is Tony?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Gone to the telegraph office,” answered Ray.
“He has about a dozen messages to send to Belmont.
He will be back shortly.”</p>

<p>Ray had hardly ceased speaking when Tony entered.
A round of cheers greeted him.</p>

<p>“Any news from Belmont?” we cried.</p>

<p>“Well, scarcely,” he answered, with a laugh as he
seated himself. “I’ve just sent my telegrams. But
I have news from the game over at Dean to-day.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, of course the Park men beat Dean all
to pieces,” said Ray. “What was the score?”</p>

<p>“Twelve to four in favor of Park,” answered Tony.
“That is somewhat different from our score with the
Dean men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “but it is not so different from
what our score <em>ought</em> to have been, and <em>would</em> have
been had we played them to-day. We were badly
handicapped.”</p>

<p>“And so were the Park men, it seems—at least
for part of the game,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Ray, looking
quickly at Tony.</p>

<p>“My telegram said that Arnold was unwell, and
did not pitch after the fourth inning.”</p>

<p>All conversation ceased in an instant. Arnold was
by all odds the most skilful pitcher in the Berkshire
League; and his record for the past two years had
never been equaled in the history of the colleges. He
was a tower of strength to the Park nine, and had
won several notable victories for them by his masterly
handling of the ball. Park College owed her success
in baseball chiefly to Arnold’s steady nerve, good judgment,
and skilful playing. He was not the captain of
the nine, for, although the position had been offered
him, he had declined in favor of Beard, the third baseman,
on the ground that his work in the pitcher’s box
would require all his attention; but he was really the
controlling authority of the nine—the power behind
the throne, so to speak.</p>

<p>The news Tony brought was therefore of the deepest
interest to us, who recognized in Arnold our most
formidable opponent. The same idea was undoubtedly
in all our minds.</p>

<p>“Arnold unwell!” I exclaimed, giving utterance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
to the common thought. “I wonder if he will be able
to play Monday.”</p>

<p>“That I can’t say,” answered Tony. “The telegram
was very brief, and gave me no clue as to the
nature or extent of his sickness.”</p>

<p>“Suppose Arnold doesn’t pitch Monday,” said
Percy Randall. “Oh, my! Won’t we have a picnic!”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t count on that at all,” answered
Ray. “You will only be the loser for it. I know
Park College of old, and I don’t take any stock in
their ‘invalids.’ Two years ago we heard rumors
from Berkeley some time before that three of their
men were laid up. All the same, the next week out
came those three ‘invalids,’ and played a rattling fine
game, doing us up to the tune of 6–4. You remember
that, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” I responded, “for one of those ‘invalids’
knocked a home run on an outcurve of mine.
Park College ‘invalids’ are dangerous men on the
ball field.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tony, “I know their tricks, too, so I
didn’t place much faith in that part of the message.
There is little doubt but that Arnold will be on hand
Monday, and keep up his record.”</p>

<p>As we left the dining room we were met in the hallway
by Slade and Bennett, of the Halford nine. It
was the first we had seen of them since the game.
They were both as pleasant as possible, and evidently
determined to let their disappointment over the results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
of the game in no way affect their behavior toward us.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Slade to me with a smile, “you deserve
to be congratulated, for you played a strong
game. We honestly thought we would win to-day,
for we calculated on finding your nine weaker than
usual. It was your game with the Dean men that
made us feel so confident, and the results to-day took
us pretty well by surprise. The fellows feel disappointed,
of course, for it throws us entirely out of the
race, but the game was fairly won, so there’s an end
of it.”</p>

<p>“Our nine has greatly improved since the Dean
game,” said Ray. “We have made several changes.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” answered Bennett; “you
played finely this afternoon, and I don’t think you
have ever put a stronger nine on the field. I don’t
feel ashamed of the defeat at all, for it was a mighty
well fought game on both sides.”</p>

<p>“You gave us very generous treatment,” said Ray,
“and we shall always remember it gratefully.”</p>

<p>“It was only a return of the courtesy we have always
received at Belmont,” answered Slade. “We
simply gave you a fair show. Everybody ought to
have that. If we had received it at Berkeley, we
might have been more successful. By the way, I suppose
you have heard the news from Dean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ray. “It was only what I expected.
Did you receive any word concerning Arnold?”</p>

<p>“No. What about him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Our telegram stated he was unwell, and gave up
pitching in the fourth inning.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be of any importance,” rejoined Slade,
“for the message I received said nothing about it.
Did he leave the field?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tony. “My telegram reads, ‘Arnold
unwell in fourth inning—changed places with
Cross.’ Cross, you know, is their substitute pitcher,
and plays right field.”</p>

<p>“Then of course it doesn’t amount to much,” said
Bennett. “The game was no doubt virtually won in
the first four innings, and so Arnold changed positions
in order to avoid all chances of straining his arm.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he was bent on taking things as easily
as possible, and saving up his strength for you next
Monday,” added Slade with a smile.</p>

<p>“That is more like the real truth of the matter,”
answered Ray. “Arnold no doubt felt confident of
the Dean game, and didn’t want to overwork himself.
I told the fellows not to put any faith in rumors
of sickness.”</p>

<p>“What were you thinking of doing this evening?”
asked Slade, looking at his watch, and changing the
subject.</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Well, our dramatic club gives an amateur performance
in the college hall, and I came over here especially
to invite you all to attend. Of course it
doesn’t amount to much as a dramatic treat, but we
always have lots of fun. What do you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>A chorus of assent greeted this proposition.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” said Slade. “I have complimentary
tickets for the whole crowd. The performance
begins at eight o’clock, so there is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>As we were going out one of the hallboys brought
Tony Larcom a telegram. Tony opened it, glanced
over its contents, and then, with a laugh, handed it to
me.</p>

<p>The telegram was from Clinton Edwards, and ran
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>News just received. Hurrah for Belmont! Let the good
work go on. I will meet you at Berkeley on Monday and
bring the “baseball chorus” with me to yell for the champions.</p>
</div>

<p>“What is the ‘baseball chorus’?” asked Percy
Randall, as the telegram passed from one to another.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a gang of about forty fellows that Clinton
has organized with a view to making the utmost
noise possible,” answered Tony. “He had them over
at Dean to cheer for us, but we didn’t give them a
chance that day. We’ll give them something more to
do Monday, and we can trust Clinton for all the support
and encouragement we need. I would back his
little band against a whole grand stand full of Park
men. If cheering is to decide that game, we will
stand a chance to win.”</p>

<p>The dramatic entertainment was highly enjoyable,
and in every respect a success. The actors acquitted
themselves with the utmost credit; and the many college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
gags and local hits that were interspersed throughout
the play gave much additional zest and enjoyment
to the performance, and kept the spectators in an almost
continual roar of laughter. Occasional responses
from the audience, and impromptu rallies of
wit between the actors and some of their friends in
front, formed a novel and amusing feature.</p>

<p>Immediately after the play an informal reception
took place, in which we were the center of interest,
and received every possible attention and courtesy.
The gentlemanly behavior on the part of the Halford
men was most highly appreciated by us, for it was
quite evident that they had fully expected to win the
game, and prepared the evening’s entertainment with a
view to celebrating the victory. The fair and generous
treatment we had received on the ball ground, and the
graceful manner with which they took their defeat,
aroused in us the sincerest feelings of gratitude, and
greatly strengthened the traditional feeling of friendship
that existed between Belmont and Halford.</p>

<p>And their attentions were unremitting during our
brief visit of two days.</p>

<p>“We will try to repay you for your kindness, when
you come over to Belmont next year,” I said to
Slade.</p>

<p>“And we will try to acknowledge the compliment by
beating you, as you did us this year,” laughed Slade.</p>

<p>“If you want to do us a real favor,” said Bennett,
“beat Park College Monday. They have had that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
banner entirely too long, and I’d give a good deal to
see you win it.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of our chances?” asked Ray.</p>

<p>“Good; that is, if you play the game you did with
us. Both Slade and I are going over to Berkeley
Monday afternoon, and we’ll lend our voices to cheer
you on.”</p>

<p>With such encouragement and good wishes we left
Halford early Monday morning.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Tony Larcom, as our train
moved away from Halford, “those fellows have
treated us so nicely, that I feel half ashamed of having
beaten them?”</p>

<p>“Well, it does seem a poor sort of return for their
kindness,” said Dick Palmer; “and yet if we had lost
the game I do not think that all their attention could
have quite reconciled me to it. We’ll strike a marked
contrast at Berkeley.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I don’t think that the Park men will embarrass
us with their attentions,” remarked Ray dryly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br>
<small>OUR RECEPTION AT BERKELEY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Whatever shadow of doubt may have remained in
our minds concerning Arnold, was speedily dissipated
on our arrival at Berkeley. No one came to meet us
at the depot; but when we reached the Wyman Hotel,
we found Arnold and Beard awaiting us there.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mr. Arnold?” said Ray, greeting
him. “I received word that you were unwell.”</p>

<p>“I unwell? Who said so?” asked Arnold.</p>

<p>“The telegram from Dean brought us that report,”
answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand now what you mean. I was
well enough, but I didn’t feel like pitching the whole
game through, so I changed places with Cross and
took a rest.”</p>

<p>This answer as well as the tone in which he spoke
indicated clearly enough that Arnold had been merely
saving himself for Monday’s game.</p>

<p>“Are all your men here?” asked Beard.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Then we shall look for you at the grounds shortly
before two o’clock,” said Beard, as if about to take
his leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“One moment,” said Tony; “the ball grounds are
some distance away. Have any arrangements been
made for carriages to take us out?”</p>

<p>“The hotel has its regular omnibus. If you speak
to the clerk at the desk I think you will find it has
been held awaiting your orders,” said Beard. He and
Arnold then walked coolly away.</p>

<p>It had always been the custom at Belmont, as well
as at Halford, for the home team to supply the visiting
players with carriage accommodation. We had hardly
looked for this attention from the Park men, but
Beard’s tone of indifference was exasperating nevertheless.
Tony could not repress a half audible exclamation
of annoyance as he hurried off to make the
necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>After our lunch we met in one of the hotel parlors
and held a short, informal meeting.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” began Ray, “I haven’t much to add
to what I’ve said many times before, but I want to repeat
one or two things. You know I told you that
there was no particular point of weakness in the Park
nine of which we could take advantage. They have an
all round good team, and we must strain every nerve to
win. I firmly believe we can do it, but we must play
right up to the mark all the time. We must play for
every point as if it were the deciding point of the
game; we must meet them, therefore, on their own
ground, and not yield an inch. We must push our
chances hard, and keep up an aggressive policy ourselves.
Their strong point is Arnold. If we can hit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
his pitching good and hard, and all the time, we will
make out all right. I am confident we can, but we
must be careful when at the bat, for he is an excellent
pitcher, and if any of us display any weakness he will
be sure to detect it and take advantage of it. As I
told you Saturday, hit hard and low.”</p>

<p>While we were still discussing the game, Tony put
his head into the room.</p>

<p>“Hurry on with your suits,” he said. “The omnibus
will be at the door in about fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>We were soon ready to start.</p>

<p>“I wonder what is the matter with Clinton Edwards,”
said Tony, looking at his watch. “He should
have been here before this.”</p>

<p>“We must have Clinton and his gang to support us,”
said Dick Palmer. “It would take some of the starch
out of me to be victimized by a grand stand full of
Park men, and not have a single backer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll make all the noise you want if it becomes
necessary,” said Tony. He looked somewhat uneasy,
however, and whispered to me, “I hope Clinton hasn’t
missed the train. His backing would do us a world
of good.”</p>

<p>The omnibus now drew up to the piazza where we
were standing. We waited a long time, but Clinton
Edwards and his companions failed to put in an appearance,
so we were compelled to drive off without
them.</p>

<p>“The loss is all their own,” said Ray cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
“They will miss seeing us win a fine game, that is
all.”</p>

<p>In baseball there is a considerable moral influence in
being well backed by friends. We had expected warm
support from Clinton Edwards and his crowd, and the
sudden blotting out of this expectation could not but
react somewhat upon our spirits. It did not, of course,
discourage us, for as Percy Randall put it, “We were
not afraid of the biggest mob Park College could get
together,” but it affected our feelings notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“Listen to that!” exclaimed Tony, as we neared the
field and heard the sounds of cheering. “The crowd
clamors for our blood.”</p>

<p>“Well, they will get it—and boiling hot, too,”
said Percy Randall. “If anything, it rather braces
me to tackle this mob all alone.”</p>

<p>“Come, fellows,” said Ray, as we drove into the
grounds. “Step out lively now, and show the stuff
that’s in you.”</p>

<p>We descended from the omnibus, and in a compact
group, approached the grand stand amidst an almost
perfect silence on the part of the spectators. The Park
men were already on the diamond, and practising with
a vim that betokened a determined and confident spirit.</p>

<p>I had half hoped to find Clinton Edwards and his
party on the field, thinking that they might perhaps
have gone directly there from the depot. Not a Belmont
man was to be seen, however, so I resigned all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
hope of backers, and made up my mind that we must
fight the battle alone.</p>

<p>We remained seated on a bench at the side of the
field, until Ray, who was standing near the home plate
in conversation with Beard, turned and beckoned to
us. The Park players were leaving the field, and it
was our turn to practise.</p>

<p>Throwing off our coats, we ran out, and set to work
in fine shape. That the crowd was watching us was
quite evident from a number of ill mannered remarks
that I could overhear from my place near the backstop;
but, beyond this, the spectators showed no appreciation
of our efforts whatever.</p>

<p>“All things considered, if we can play well enough
to keep their mouths shut I shall be satisfied,” I said to
Dick Palmer.</p>

<p>At this moment Ray left Beard, and came quickly
toward us.</p>

<p>“We are in luck to start with,” he said. “We have
won the toss.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the umpire came upon the
field, carrying in his hand the new ball with which
the game was to be played.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ray.</p>

<p>“Then get your men in position.”</p>

<p>We took our places, and the ball was tossed to me.
No batter had stepped up, so I looked inquiringly toward
the bench where the Park men were seated.
Then, as Arnold, their first batter, rose and picked up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
his bat, a student stepped out in front of the grand
stand, and waving his cane, cried, “I propose three
cheers for the nine. Now, fellows, give it to them.”</p>

<p>A roar of cheers burst from the crowd.</p>

<p>“Another one,” cried the leader, and again came
the cheers.</p>

<p>“One more round,” and a third time the crowd
responded.</p>

<p>This evidently had been expected by the Park nine,
for Arnold stood as if awaiting it; and it was quite
as evident to me that it was simply the beginning of
a concerted action on the part of the crowd to demoralize
us by shouting.</p>

<p>Before the sound had died away we heard another
cheer far away outside the field. We looked at one another
in surprise. Was it an echo? No, for again it
sounded, and this time nearer and clearer. Suddenly
the truth flashed upon me. I turned quickly toward
the entrance to the grounds. There was a thick cloud
of dust in the road outside, and a rumble of heavy
wheels; then the carriage gates burst open, and into
the field rolled three large omnibuses gayly decked out
with the beautiful blue banners of Belmont. Down
the smooth roadway that skirted the diamond cantered
the teams, while from the omnibuses burst roar after
roar of cheers.</p>

<p>As the vehicles took up a position on the opposite
side of the field from the mass of the Park crowd,
the well known form of Clinton Edwards emerged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
from the inside of one of the omnibuses. Climbing on
top, he shouted, “Now, boys, blow on your lungs.”</p>

<p>A terrific roar ensued. Then, having vindicated
himself, Clinton Edwards sat down, and awaited the
opening of the game. This novel response to the
grand stand had a telling and dramatic effect. The
crowd could scarcely have been more surprised had a
bombshell fallen in front of them. For a moment
they were completely staggered, and the whole effect
of their cheering was destroyed.</p>

<p>Whether Clinton Edwards had premeditated the surprise
or not, his entrance could not have been more
timely. Its effect upon us was magnetic, and our
spirits rose mightily as the old familiar Belmont cheer
rang out. Ray Wendell waved his hand to Clinton
Edwards, while I, seeing that Arnold had taken his
place at the home plate, grasped the ball, and made
ready.</p>

<p>“Play!” cried the umpire, and the game began.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
<small>THE THIRD GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I placed the ball over the inner corner of the base,
Arnold struck it good and hard, and sent it flying
along the ground toward third base. Quick as a
flash Percy Randall picked it up and threw it to first.</p>

<p>“Batter out,” cried the umpire, and the three omnibuses
again became noisy. Two more men were
easily disposed of, and we closed our opponents out
without a run.</p>

<p>Thus far the fun had been all our own, while the
grand stand had kept silence. Immediately on leaving
the field to take our innings, several of us ran over
to the omnibuses to greet our friends.</p>

<p>“Why were you so late?” I called to Clinton Edwards.</p>

<p>“We drove all the way over—didn’t come by rail,
for we knew we couldn’t hire omnibuses in this hole
of a town. We didn’t start early enough, and I was
afraid we were going to miss part of the game. It’s
all right now, so go in and win. We are ‘wid yez.’”</p>

<p>We failed, however, to make a run in our half of
the first inning, three of our men, in succession, succumbing
to the skilful pitching of Arnold. This gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
the grand stand a chance, and they responded with a
will. They had recovered from their first surprise
by this time, and settled down to their original plan
of shouting us into demoralization. It was a vain
task, however, with those noisy omnibuses opposite.
Clinton Edward’s party paid them back in their own
coin every time, and the effect upon us was proportionately
inspiring.</p>

<p>No runs were made on either side in the second inning.
In the third inning their first batter secured a
hit, the first one of the game, and reached his base
amid howls from the grand stand. He reached second
through a bad throw of Dick Palmer’s. The next
batter then struck a pop fly up in the air just over
short-stop. George Ives stood waiting for it, when
the runner from second base ran full tilt into him,
upsetting him and reaching third base while the ball
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>We claimed a foul, but the runner declared that
Ives was directly in his path, where he had no business
to be, and the umpire decided against him.
George may have been in the runner’s path, but it
was plainly a trick, for no runner would have attempted
to run from second under such circumstances
except with the intention of knocking George down,
as he could only in that way gain third base.</p>

<p>Immediately a warm discussion took place in which
the runner became so actively engaged that he thoughtlessly
left his base, and stood several feet off. Percy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Randall noticing this, and having picked up the ball
unobserved by the others, called out,</p>

<p>“Mr. Umpire, have you called time?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Then how is that?” asked Percy, quickly touching
the runner with the ball.</p>

<p>“The runner is out!” said the umpire beckoning
to him to come in.</p>

<p>Chagrined and mortified, the runner walked sulkily
in. The Park men were badly upset by this clever
dodge, for they felt confident of securing a run, there
being no men out, and a man on third. They did not
regain their lost advantage, and we closed the inning
with the score still blank.</p>

<p>From that time on the crowd selected Percy Randall
for their special attention, and sought in every way
to disconcert him. They had picked out the wrong
man, however. Percy played away as unconcernedly
as if he heard nothing, and if anything with more than
his usual dash and brilliancy. He was the first man
at the bat in the fourth inning, and the second ball
pitched struck him on the arm. He was of course
given his base.</p>

<p>“Now is your chance, Percy,” said Ray. “Get
away to second at once. There are no men out.”</p>

<p>Percy was off like the wind, and reached second
base in safety by one of his phenomenal slides, which
of course brought the voices of Clinton Edwards’ chorus
into vigorous play.</p>

<p>I came next to the bat. We had thus far been unable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
to do anything with Arnold, who was pitching
in magnificent form, and we were beginning to fear
we never could handle him. I watched my chances
carefully, and succeeded in driving a hard ball to the
short stop. Percy Randall purposely made a start
toward third, and the short stop, on picking up the
ball, turned to keep him at second. In this way he
lost several seconds—time enough to allow me to
reach first base. Then Ray came to the bat.</p>

<p>“If he will repeat his exploit of Saturday, we will
have a great lead,” I thought.</p>

<p>At the first ball Ray struck hard, driving it well
up into the air and out between left and center field.
It was an easy fly to catch, and I fully expected to see
the fielder capture it, so I did not start off very fast.
To my surprise, however, the fielder had not run ten
steps when his foot slipped, and down he tumbled,
the ball alighting on the ground some distance behind
him. A loud exclamation of disappointment escaped
the crowd, while Percy and I dashed around the bases;
and before the fielder could pick himself up and get
the ball, both of us scored, and Ray stood on third
base.</p>

<p>Our friends went wild with joy, while the Park
men were glum and silent. Before the inning closed,
Ray reached home on a sacrifice hit of Frank Holland’s
to right field, and the score stood 3–0 in our
favor. The Park men then bent every nerve to the
task of tying the score.</p>

<p>Foes though they were, I gave them the credit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
playing a splendid up hill game. In the sixth inning
they secured one run, and in the eighth inning another,
making the score 3–2. During these innings
Arnold’s work had been exceptionally fine, and we
had been unable to make more than two or three safe
hits.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Arnold is almost too much for us to-day,”
said Ray to me. “Our hope lies chiefly in holding
the lead. If we can do so for one more inning,
the game is ours.”</p>

<p>We went into the field for the ninth inning with the
determination to do or die. The first batter was
promptly put out by a ground hit which Ray captured
neatly, in spite of the disconcerting howls from the
grand stand. As the excitement had increased during
the latter part of the game, the behavior of the Park
men had of course grown more riotous. In every way
they had tried to put us out by their noise, but our
attention was so absorbed in our work that it had
scarcely affected us.</p>

<p>The second batter in this last inning reached first on
a safe hit, and was followed by Arnold, who, from the
scowl he wore, seemed bent on knocking the cover off
the ball. I was sorry to see him at the bat at such
a moment, for he was a strong batter, and I was
pretty well tired out by my hard work of the afternoon
and Saturday. Several balls were called, and I was
compelled to send one directly over the plate. Arnold
saw his chance and took it.</p>

<p>With a sharp crack he sent the ball away out toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
right field, and reached second base in safety, sending
the former runner to third. This made two men out,
with runners on second and third bases.</p>

<p>Beard then came to the bat. From the care with
which he settled himself, one could see he appreciated
the gravity of the situation. If he succeeded in making
a heavy hit, the chances were that he could bring
in two runs.</p>

<p>At the second ball he struck wildly; and, more by
chance than good judgment, drove it well up into the
air toward center field. We all looked after it with
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“Take it, Page!” cried Ray, as he saw both Lewis
Page and Alfred Barnett run for it. Arnold and the
other runner ran around toward the home plate. The
fate of the game, therefore, rested on Lewis Page,
who now stood well under the ball, his hands up,
ready to receive it. We watched its descent in breathless
suspense. Downward it shot like a swallow.
Lewis Page’s hands closed quickly about it.</p>

<p>“Striker out,” called the umpire, and the game was
over.</p>

<p>Immediately the field was a scene of wild confusion.
In a mass, Clinton Edward’s band of followers, who
had been with difficulty suppressing their excitement,
charged across the roadway, shouting and cheering.
Seizing hold of us, they hugged and tore us half to
pieces in their joy.</p>

<p>“Boys, it was glorious,” croaked Clinton, in a hoarse
voice scarcely above a whisper. “I wouldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
missed it for the world. The Crimson Banner will
soon be ours;” and off he went again into a wild
fit of ecstasy, clasping the man who happened to be
nearest to him.</p>

<p>Among those pressing around to congratulate Ray I
was interested in seeing Len Howard. I had not noticed
him in any of the omnibuses, but he seemed to
be one of the most enthusiastic. The fellows were
eager to carry us off with them, but Ray objected.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “We have our omnibus, and we
must return to the hotel, for I have to see Beard by
agreement after the game.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend driving back to Belmont?” I asked
Clinton.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Then, if you expect to get there before we do, you
will have to start soon, for we go by train.”</p>

<p>“You don’t return till after dinner?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then we will have time. We want to get back
before you, so as to prepare the boys. We must have
a bonfire to-night.”</p>

<p>As soon as some measure of order could be restored
Clinton got his crowd together into the omnibuses; and
after a farewell round of cheers, they took their leave,
while we drove back to the hotel. The rest of the
spectators had dispersed in angry silence.</p>

<p>“Well, talk about luck!” exclaimed Tony, as he
came into the room where we were changing our suits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
and packing our things. “How was that for a close
shave?”</p>

<p>“Entirely too close,” answered Ray. “We climbed
through a pretty small hole to-day. One or two more
innings, and they might have got away with us. We
won by pure luck, and we haven’t much to boast of.
I tell you what it is, fellows, if we are going to win
that Crimson Banner, we will have to learn how to
hit Arnold’s pitching. He had us fairly at his mercy
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they outplayed us,” said Percy Randall.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” answered Ray, “but they played a
stronger game than I expected, and I didn’t feel at all
sure of our success until the last man was out. I gave
a long sigh of relief when Lewis Page gobbled up that
fly ball. All we want to do is to bat stronger. If we
can get the best of Arnold we can beat them any number
of times. Batting is what we need to practise.”</p>

<p>After dinner, Ray, Tony, and I were standing on the
hotel piazza where a number of the students and town
men were assembled. Among the former was Beard,
who came forward as he caught a glimpse of Ray’s
face. The result of the game had not improved his
disposition. He was morose and surly. At the first
words of the interview, Arnold, who had been standing
a short distance away, came forward and joined
us.</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be better to write you concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the decisive game,” said Ray, addressing Beard.
“I do not feel able at present to suggest a date.”</p>

<p>“I do not see any reason for a ‘decisive game,’”
said Arnold coldly.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” I asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>“The rules of the League say nothing about decisive
games,” answered Arnold. “We have the
Crimson Banner, and we hold it in case of a tie. We
hold it until some other college can win it from us.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Arnold,” said Ray quietly, “the rules of the
League say that, in case of a tie, it can be played off
according to any arrangement agreed upon between the
captains of the two competing nines. Allow me to say
that I arranged before the game this afternoon with
Mr. Beard, your captain, that we should play a decisive
game at Belmont in case of a tie.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Arnold irritably, turning to Beard.
“Do you mean to say that you made any such arrangement?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Beard, looking away.</p>

<p>“Well, what under the sun did you—Beard, you’ve
made a fool of yourself,” said Arnold.</p>

<p>“As Mr. Beard is captain, and not you, Mr. Arnold,
I don’t see what importance your opinion can be in
this interview,” said Ray. “As I tell you, arrangements
for a decisive game have been made. You
surely can have no objections to playing the season to
a satisfactory finish. You must see to what unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
criticism your refusal to play would subject you.”</p>

<p>“We will play you when and where you choose,”
said Arnold, turning angrily on his heel and leaving
us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br>
<small>THE RETURN TO BELMONT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ray Wendell’s foresight had saved us much
trouble and annoyance. It so happened that the rules
of the Berkshire League made little provision in case
of two colleges tying for the championship. This deficiency
had entirely escaped the attention of those who
had originally framed the rules; and as no tie in the
competition had ever occurred thus far in the experience
of the colleges, the matter had been altogether
overlooked. While every student believed that tie
would always be settled by an extra game, there was
no definite rule requiring it. The nearest approach
to it was the clause to which Ray alluded, and which
provided for only such settlement of a tie as should
be mutually agreed upon by the captains of the competing
nines.</p>

<p>Of course this was intended to mean that a deciding
game should be played, for the framers of the rules
took it for granted that both captains would be eager
to settle the championship in this way, but the rule
was so unsatisfactorily worded as to leave either captain
free to decline a deciding game without sacrificing
the championship. The matter had not escaped Ray’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
attention, and he had been sharp enough to detect this
deficiency. Foreseeing the possibility of the Park
men making just such a claim as Arnold advanced, he
had approached Beard before the game, and had arranged
the matter completely.</p>

<p>We were highly elated over Ray’s strategic move;
and that, added to the delight we experienced in reviewing
our successful tour, filled our cup of joy to
overflowing. All the coldness, rudeness, bad humor,
and chagrin that met us on every hand during our
brief stay at Berkeley could not dampen our spirits
one iota; and when once aboard the train and bound
for Belmont, our feelings found joyous vent in shouting
and singing, till the sober passengers about us
rose and betook themselves to the other cars, thinking,
no doubt, that bedlam itself was off on a pleasure
tour. We soon had things to ourselves, and then the
fun increased until the conductor himself could stand
it no longer.</p>

<p>“This ain’t no cattle train,” he said. “If you fellers
wants to raise a racket, go ahead into the baggage
room, and give the other passengers a show.”</p>

<p>The noisier ones, accordingly, under Percy Randall’s
leadership, betook themselves to the baggage
compartment at the forward end of the car, where they
had free scope for their <em>specialties</em>; while several of
us remained to talk our experiences over more quietly.</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is, Ray,” said Dick Palmer, “you
are a trump. Your cute little stroke with Beard was
as great a victory as the game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“What particularly pleased me,” answered Ray,
“was Beard’s agreement to play the deciding game
on our grounds. I had hardly hoped to win that
point. I expected, of course, that he would reject the
proposition positively, or at least that he would demand
that the question of the grounds should be decided
by lot. I was prepared to meet him in that demand
if he had insisted; so when he accepted my
proposition as I first stated it, he nearly took my breath
away.”</p>

<p>“What could have made him so obliging, I wonder?”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, he carried the high and mighty air. He was
so cocksure of winning the game that he was ready
to agree to anything that depended on his losing it.
He smiled in a superior way when I spoke to him, and
used a condescending tone as much as to say, ‘Oh,
yes, I might just as well agree with you as not. It
won’t make any difference, for we are going to wipe
up the field with you anyhow.’ You may imagine,
then, how he felt when Arnold called him a fool before
all those fellows on the piazza of the Wyman
Hotel.”</p>

<p>“When had we better play the deciding game?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Ray. “We can tell better
after thinking it over—the later the better; for I,
for one, shall be very busy during the next week preparing
for final examinations. Tony!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>Tony was busily figuring in his memorandum book,
and did not answer.</p>

<p>“Tony, what are you at there?” asked Ray.</p>

<p>“Oh, the accounts, of course,” answered Tony. “I
have been so busy with the scores and other matters
lately that I have rather let them slide. They are all
right now, though.”</p>

<p>“How do we stand?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Over $150 still in the treasury,” he answered.
“Our trip has cost us less than $100, and our expenses
for this season are almost at an end. Taking
into account the profits we will derive from the deciding
game at Belmont, we ought to have a large
balance in our favor to carry over to next year.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope the fellows don’t begrudge the money
they have contributed to baseball this term,” said Ray.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound as if they did, does it?” questioned
Tony significantly, as the distant sound of
cheers greeted us—cheers that came not from the
baggage room, where our companions were, but from
the platform of Belmont depot, towards which we
were rapidly approaching. As the train slackened
speed, Percy Randall and the rest came tumbling back
into the car; and we hurriedly gathered together our
traps and crowded out upon the platform.</p>

<p>What college man who has ever played ball can
forget the glad moment when, after a hard fought and
successful tour, he returns to receive the enthusiastic
congratulations of his fellow students; the pleasurable
thrill with which he first hears the sound of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
voices; the joyous, clamorous greeting as the old
familiar depot is reached; the happy, noisy throng that
receives him with open arms; the shouting, laughing,
singing, cheering, and the thousand other delightful
details that constitute his triumph!</p>

<p>All this was ours; and Belmont has still to look forward
to a bigger bonfire than was piled up and consumed
on the old back campus that night. To be
sure, our joy was tempered by the consideration that
the championship was still to be won, that the Crimson
Banner was still to be wrested from the hands of the
Park men by a deciding game; but, nevertheless, our
prospects had so suddenly brightened, our tour had
been so brilliantly successful, and our success augured
so well for the future, that an anticipatory triumph
was quite natural and justifiable.</p>

<p>“We might just as well have our bonfire now, for
the tour alone is worthy of it,” said Clinton Edwards,
when Ray suggested that perhaps the triumph was a
little premature. “We can easily have another one
when we win the championship. There is plenty of
fuel lying loose around town. I would contribute all
the furniture in my room if I thought it would be any
help towards bringing the Crimson Banner back to
Belmont.”</p>

<p>These remarks were made in the lowest and hoarsest
of whispers, for Clinton’s voice, like those of his worthy
“chorus,” had perished of overwork. Once or twice
during the evening when the fun raged hottest, I saw
him make a heroic effort to join in the cheering, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
finding it useless, shake his head despairingly, and betake
himself to banging on a big bass drum, which
a member of the college instrumental club had brought
into service. But Clinton and his chorus had done
their work nobly that day, and no member of our nine
will ever forget their timely appearance and loyal
support at Berkeley.</p>

<p>As the hour grew late, the excitement waned, and
gradually the mass of students broke up into small
knots, and moved away. I was feeling fatigued from
the exertions and nervous strain of the game and the
evening’s celebration; so, about half past ten, I went
to my room, and there, lying off at ease, I watched
from my windows the slow dispersion of the revelers
on the campus below me until the last group had disappeared.</p>

<p>And long after my fellow students, wearied by shouting,
had retired to their various apartments, the fire
burned on in the silent night, crackling, sizzling, and
darting its fitful beams into my room, where they set
grotesque and fanciful shadows dancing on ceiling and
walls, and blending their lurid and wavering gleams
with the myriad faces and images that the day’s
memory recalled to my dreams.</p>

<small>BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Final examinations were now impending, and the
preparation for them engaged our earnest attention
night and day. The pressure upon Ray Wendell was
particularly severe; for, being a Senior, his examinations
took place during the first week in June. Ray,
moreover, was determined to obtain a high rank in his
class, and one of the honorary orations to which such
a rank would entitle him. These orations were allowed
to the first ten men in the Senior class, and as
they were delivered on Commencement Day in the
town hall before all the college faculty, trustees, and
assembled guests, they were coveted and striven for as
positions of marked distinction.</p>

<p>The valedictorian was selected by the faculty, and
for the oration they chose the best speaker among the
first six men in the class. It was this particular position
that Ray desired; and in the estimation of his
fellow students, his securing it depended solely upon
him winning a place amongst the first six, for Ray was
well known to be one of the best speakers in his class.</p>

<p>The week after our return from Berkeley, therefore,
was one of steady, arduous work for Ray; and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the exception of the regular hours of baseball practice
and meal time, he was to be found in his room, bent
over his text books and lecture notes. And late at
night, as I would retire, I could see his windows over
in Warburton Hall shining brightly long after the rest
of the building was darkened.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions I could not resist the temptation
to run over for a few moments and break in on
his loneliness; so, slipping on my coat, I crossed the
quadrangle, and ascended to his room.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Harry,” he said, opening the door for me.
“What are you doing out of bed at this hour of the
night?”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, Ray, I came over here to
ask you the very same question. I saw this one solitary
light burning, and I was drawn to it like a bug
on a summer night.”</p>

<p>“Come in and sit down,” he answered heartily. “I
was pegging away at mathematics, and you know how
I hate it. I was just wishing that some one would
stroll in and vary the monotony when I heard your
step.”</p>

<p>“How are you making out with your preparation?”
I asked, sitting down on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Very well. I am losing no time—at it every
minute, and I think I will win my place. Mathematics
is all that troubles me. You know they examine us
on the past two years’ work, and I find myself dreadfully
rusty in my Junior year studies.”</p>

<p>“I pity you heartily,” I answered, “and I know how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
you feel, for I am looking forward already to my own
examinations three weeks from now. Why, that looks
like a trigonometry,” I added, pointing to the book
that lay on the desk before him.</p>

<p>“It is,” he answered. “I am brushing up my
Junior year work, and, as I said, I find myself very
rusty.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not,” I said, rising quickly, “for that is
just what I am studying now. Here, let us tackle it
together. I can help you along faster, for I have it
all fresh in my mind. Besides, it will serve me for
preparation for my own examination.”</p>

<p>“Will you do that?” asked Ray.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. I don’t want to waste your time
talking. Let us put our heads together, and I will
help you finish up your Junior year work.”</p>

<p>“All right, Harry, that’s a capital idea. Make up
your mind to stay here tonight, and we will do up the
whole thing while we are at it. Throw off your coat,
and draw up your chair. Here is a pencil and some
paper.”</p>

<p>I joined him at the desk, and we were soon deep in
our work. So absorbed were we that we scarcely
noticed the flight of time. It was therefore with a
start of surprise that I looked at the clock as we
finished our work.</p>

<p>“Well, who would have thought it!” I exclaimed.
“I wouldn’t have believed that I had been here more
than two hours, and yet look at the time. It is nearly
four o’clock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>I rose and went to the window. Off in the east, the
first gray streaks of dawn were appearing. Over our
work we had sat the night nearly through. Ray was
leaning back wearily, his hands behind his head, his
eyes closed.</p>

<p>“See here, Ray,” I suddenly exclaimed, “have you
been at your books this late every night?”</p>

<p>He did not answer me. Approaching him and looking
more closely into his face, I discovered that he
had fallen sound asleep, sitting bolt upright in his
chair. This, in itself, was answer enough to my question.
I shook him gently by the arm. He started
and looked up.</p>

<p>“I said it was very late, Ray. Didn’t you hear
me?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he answered. “I didn’t hear another
thing after you closed the book.”</p>

<p>“Ray, you must be careful,” I said. “Four o’clock
is bad enough for one night, but it doesn’t pay to repeat
it, as I am sure you have. You will make yourself
sick, and then you won’t be any good, either for
playing baseball or speaking honorary orations—you
notice I put playing baseball first,” I added with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you fear. I won’t get sick,” he
answered. “I own I am tired, for I have been keeping
late hours—or <em>early</em> hours you might call them,
for a week, but then I had to in order to get in shape
for examinations. All I need is some sleep and I
will be as fresh as ever. This is Friday night; after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
tomorrow these late hours will be over, and then I
can get plenty of rest.”</p>

<p>“Well, see that you do, for you evidently need it,”
I said. “Come on and get to sleep now without more
delay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” said Ray, as he rose and picked
up a letter from the floor. “Here is a matter that I
was just going to speak about when you suggested
working together. It is a letter from Berkeley which
Tony Larcom handed to me this afternoon. He has
been writing the Park men about the date for the deciding
game. Tony, according to my suggestion, has
urged as late a day as possible. They have examinations
over there almost the same time that we do, so
they seemed to be quite agreeable to a delay. There
has been some little correspondence concerning the
matter, and this is their final letter, in which they agree
to the date suggested by Tony; that is, the 21st of
June.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is the day before Commencement,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ray, “and all the better on that
account. It will mean a large crowd of visitors and
friends. This, of course, will swell the receipts of the
Baseball Association, and will give us a strong and
enthusiastic backing. There will be a great many
graduates here to rejoice with us if we win the championship.”</p>

<p>“It will be a great day, and we must not fail to do
ourselves proud,” I responded. “Tell me frankly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Ray, which would you rather do: win the championship,
or secure the valedictory oration?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t try to catch me that way,” laughed
Ray. “I shall not express any preference. I want
<em>both</em>, and I intend to get both if possible.”</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” I answered as we retired.
“I sincerely hope you will.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br>
<small>GOOD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next week Ray was passing through his examinations,
and I saw little of him. For several successive
days he was even unable to be at the ball
ground for our regular practice. By Friday, however,
he had passed the last examination, and was free
until commencement time. I was in a position to envy
him this leisure, for my trial was just about to begin.
The severest and most disagreeable tasks, however,
have an end; and so, after a week’s hard driving with
pen and paper in the large examination hall, I too
found freedom. I was confident that I had done well,
and felt reason to believe that I had gained a higher
rank in my class than the year previous.</p>

<p>Ray, though hoping for the best, could not be sure
of the results of his examination, for the competition
for rank in his class was very sharp, and he was working
against students of great ability. The ten days
that followed his examinations formed, therefore, a
period of much suspense and anxiety to him. My
work was finished on Friday, a little more than a week
before Commencement; and that evening I determined
to call upon Professor Fuller to learn, if possible, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
I had succeeded in his department. Professor Fuller
often gave advance information of this kind concerning
his own branch of work; and on this occasion,
showed no hesitation in telling me that I had secured
a grade from him several points higher than ever before.
Highly pleased at this information, I was on
the point of leaving the professor’s house when I heard
some one say,</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Elder.”</p>

<p>Turning half around, I saw Miss Nettie Fuller
standing at the other end of the piazza. I joined her
at once.</p>

<p>“I have been waiting for you to come out, Mr.
Elder,” she said; “for I have information that I know
will interest—will interest some of your friends.”
She hesitated on the word “some.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There was a faculty meeting this afternoon, and
the honormen were read off,” she said in a low tone
of voice.</p>

<p>“Yes; and Ray Wendell?” I exclaimed eagerly.
“How does he stand?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wendell was chosen valedictorian. He was
fourth in his class,” she answered quietly, but with an
air of genuine pleasure in imparting such welcome
information.</p>

<p>I could have jumped for joy.</p>

<p>“Is it really true?” I exclaimed. “Really settled
beyond doubt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my father told me this afternoon. It is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
publicly announced to-morrow. Mr. Wendell was
here last evening, and I could see that he was worrying
over the matter, so I thought I would give you
an opportunity to relieve his anxiety. There is no
harm in his learning the news several hours in advance,
and it might save him considerable suspense.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it will,” I answered warmly. “I will take
the good news to him at once, for I know it will lift
a great load off his mind. It is very kind of you to
let him know of it so soon.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know whether I ought to have spoken or
not,” she said, with a smile, “but when I saw you
coming in, I couldn’t resist the opportunity of telling
such agreeable news. Isn’t Mr. Howard also a friend
of yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t remember all the honormen, for the
names were unfamiliar to me, but I do recollect my
father saying that Mr. Howard was the ninth man in
his class.”</p>

<p>“Howard!” I exclaimed in surprise. “Is he an
honorman? I wouldn’t have thought it. He always
held a respectable position in his class, but I would
never have picked him out for an honorman.”</p>

<p>“My father said that Mr. Howard has improved
wonderfully of late,” replied Miss Nettie.</p>

<p>“Yes, he must have,” I answered; “and I’m very
glad to hear that he has done so well. May I tell
him the news, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said hesitatingly, “but no one else please.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
I see no harm in letting them know, for father himself
would have told them had he seen them this evening;
but I suppose it is not my place to give the information.”</p>

<p>“It will be all the more appreciated,” I responded
as I took my leave, “and I promise that no one but
Ray and Howard shall know of it to-night.”</p>

<p>I lost no time in returning to the college to find
Ray Wendell. From the campus I could see that his
room was lighted up; so, hurrying up the stairs, I
threw open his door without knocking, and had the
news upon my tongue’s end when I discovered that
Ray was not alone. Two of his classmates were with
him; so, checking myself in time, I sat down quietly
near Ray, and when the opportunity afforded itself I
said in a low tone of voice,</p>

<p>“Come in the other room a moment. I have some
good news for you.”</p>

<p>Ray looked at me quickly an instant, and then, excusing
himself, rose and followed me. His feelings
may be imagined when, without a word of preparation,
I suddenly popped the news upon him.</p>

<p>For several seconds he could say nothing. He
seemed to be almost afraid to believe it. “Harry, are
you sure—there can be no mistake?” he asked in a
whisper, his voice trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>I reassured him by telling him the source from
which I had obtained the information. I could only
guess at the effect of my words, for the room was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
dark and I could not see his face. He clasped my
hand and pressed it warmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you a thousand times for telling me,
Harry,” he said fervently.</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me—thank Miss Nettie,” I answered
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Ray said nothing, but his face, as we rejoined the
others, betrayed his struggle with his feelings, and it
was some time before his voice resumed its customary
calmness of tone.</p>

<p>A number of visitors dropped in during the evening,
and by nine o’clock the room was well filled with
students, and echoing with the sounds of mingled conversation
and laughter. In this gay group Ray’s exceptional
buoyancy of spirits passed unnoticed, and
only I knew that his high color and sparkling eyes
spoke of a happiness too complete for words.</p>

<p>Among the last of these visitors Len Howard came
in. I was somewhat surprised at this, for he was
seldom to be seen at Ray’s rooms; but a short time
sufficed to convince me that he had some particular
purpose in coming.</p>

<p>He took little share in the conversation, sitting quietly
on the sofa—on the same sofa and in the very spot
where he had made his terrible confession to us several
weeks before. As the visitors one after another
departed Howard still sat there, seemingly determined
to be the last to go. By eleven o’clock all had left the
room except Howard, Ray, and myself. Almost before
the door had closed upon the last visitor, Howard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
rose up, and taking a thick envelope from his pocket
placed it upon the table in front of Ray.</p>

<p>“There, Ray,” he said in accents of genuine satisfaction,
“I came in to give you that.”</p>

<p>Ray opened the envelope in wonder. A thick roll
of bills fell out.</p>

<p>“Why, Howard,” he exclaimed, “what does all this
money mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that I am determined you shall be repaid
every cent I owe you as fast as I can earn it,”
answered Howard. “There is my first payment, four
hundred dollars, and I will pay you the rest as soon
as possible. I haven’t had an easy moment until
now——”</p>

<p>“But, Howard,” burst out Ray, “I didn’t intend
you to worry so about it. I meant you to take your
time—why, how on earth did you raise all this money?—excuse
my question, but you know you said you
were in straitened circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” answered Howard quietly,
“but it is all right. I have earned it. I went to
Professor Fuller for advice, and he suggested my
tutoring some of the under classmen, and when I accepted
the idea, he and Mr. Dykes secured me several
pupils in the Sophomore and Freshman classes—fellows
who were behind in their studies and needed
coaching.”</p>

<p>“Howard, you are doing splendidly,” said Ray
warmly. “I understand your feelings, and I admire
you for them. They are of the right sort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“Then you are satisfied with your investment?”
said Howard, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am,” said Ray. “I knew it was in you,
and am delighted to see you doing so well.”</p>

<p>“So am I, Howard,” I added, “and I have some
good news for you.”</p>

<p>He looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>“The faculty met to-day, and the honormen were
announced,” I continued.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, and who were they?” he asked, leaning
forward eagerly, and breathing rapidly.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” I said, seeking to relieve his
anxiety at once; “you stand ninth in the class, and
have an honorary oration.”</p>

<p>Howard’s face flushed, his head dropped, and he
leaned heavily for a few moments against the mantlepiece.</p>

<p>“Why, Howard!” exclaimed Ray. “Is this true?
I congratulate you, my dear fellow, with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“It is true, Howard,” I continued, “for I got the
information through Professor Fuller.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a second, and then when
Howard raised his face, I could see that his eyes were
moist.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only knew how hard I worked for an
oration!” he exclaimed, as if apologizing for his manner.
“When Ray gave me a lift and I determined to
turn over a new leaf, I made up my mind for one
thing, that I would do the best I could in the little
time that was left me in college. In Freshman year I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
stood well up in my class, and, even since then, found
no difficulty in holding a fair rank, but I was conscious
of having wasted many opportunities, and having
neglected my studies. I thought of my father,
who knows nothing of my experience—who has all
along thought that I was a model son, and has denied
himself and saved at every point to secure me
an education, and supply me with the money which I
squandered so recklessly. I had deceived him long
enough, so I determined that I would go in and work
hard to secure a position of honor, in order that it
might serve as some return for all that he had done
for me. I was severely handicapped, but I worked
incessantly, and—well—now it is all right.”
Howard ended abruptly, his voice trembling with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Howard, you ought certainly to feel proud, for
you have accomplished wonders,” said Ray. “You
have gained twelve or more positions in one term.
You deserve more credit than any man on the honor
list.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so much of myself,” said Howard,
“for I suppose that the knowledge I have crammed
into my head so rapidly will, for the most part, slip
away after a few months; but it was for the old
gentleman I worked chiefly—you see I am paying
back my debts in every way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your father will come on to Commencement,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. He wouldn’t miss it for the world;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
and I know how proud and happy he will be. I
must write him a letter to-night, and tell him all about
it,” said Howard, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>“And are you sure that this does not inconvenience
you?” said Ray, fingering the bills.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” answered Howard, as he took
his leave. “It is all extra money, outside of my expenses,
and it makes me easier to give it to you.”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Ray, with a smile, as the door closed
upon Howard. “Didn’t I tell you he would keep his
promise?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII<br>
<small>THE FINAL GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Belmont was looking her prettiest on the day before
Commencement. It seemed as if the town, the
college grounds, the buildings, the trees, and even
nature itself had summoned the pleasantest expression
to greet the host of guests that thronged to the Commencement
exercises. Of these exercises the great
baseball game formed one of the most important and
interesting in the eyes at least of graduates and undergraduates;
and the special interest that centered
in this game had brought to Belmont a largely increased
number of friends.</p>

<p>We were expecting the Park men on the 11:30 train;
so, shortly after eleven o’clock, Tony Larcom, Ray
Wendell, and I went down to the depot with an omnibus
to meet them. We were determined that no
charge of rudeness or neglect should be brought to
our door, so we had made provision for the Park men
at our club a week in advance, and had arranged for
rooms where they could leave their baggage.</p>

<p>They seemed to take this as a matter of course, and
manifested neither by word nor act the least appreciation
of the care we had taken to make them
comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>Long before two o’clock—the hour of beginning
the game—the box office at the entrance to the
grounds was besieged by a large and jostling crowd
of students and graduates who had been unable to get
reserved seats in the grand stand and were compelled
to take their chances of a seat on the benches that
flanked two sides of the diamond.</p>

<p>“Just listen to that, Harry,” remarked Tony, as the
clink of silver greeted our ears. “A great treasury
we’ll have to-night.”</p>

<p>During the next quarter hour, the grand stand and
benches filled rapidly; and by the time we stepped out
on the field in our uniforms a double row of spectators,
who had been unable to get seats of any kind, almost
encircled the grounds.</p>

<p>We were greeted with three times three cheers, and
settled down to practice in good spirits. The Park
men, in their turn, received a generous greeting, and
were given a chance to exhibit themselves. As we
came in from the field Ray nodded to me with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>“Our fellows are in good feather, Harry,” he said.
“If we can’t beat them to-day, we never can.”</p>

<p>At this moment the umpire came out with the new
ball in his hand. Ray and Beard approached him; a
few words were exchanged, the coin was tossed, and
then Ray turned on his heel and came back toward
me.</p>

<p>“They won the toss,” he said. “Get your bat ready,
Harry; you are first on the list.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>I stepped forward to the homeplate, the Park men
took their various positions; the crowd became still;
the umpire tossed the snowy white ball along the
ground to Arnold, then raised his hand and cried,
“Play!”</p>

<p>Instantly the ball came in like a flash of light. I
was unprepared for it, but struck at it fiercely, and to
my own surprise, drove a fine two base hit out toward
right field. It was an auspicious beginning, and was
greeted by an uproar from the benches.</p>

<p>This sobered Arnold, who began more cautiously
with George Ives, who followed me, and succeeded in
striking him out. Then came Alfred Burnett, who
knocked to shortstop, and was thrown out at first base;
I in the mean time reaching third base. Dick Palmer
was next at the bat, and proved himself worthy of
the trust we had always reposed in his batting abilities
by making a single base hit, and bringing me home,
thus scoring the first run. The half inning was closed
by Percy Randall’s knocking a high fly which was
captured by the Park left fielder. We then took the
field.</p>

<p>I had pitched only a few balls when I discovered that
the Park men had improved considerably in batting
since we last met them, and that I would need all the
strength and skill I could summon to manage them.
They hit hard nearly every time, and it was only good
fielding on the part of our men that prevented their
scoring several runs in the first inning. As it was
they earned one run, and the score stood 1–1. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
this condition it remained for two more innings, but
in the ending of the fourth inning, their strong batting
secured two more runs for them.</p>

<p>In the fifth inning Ray Wendell opened with a base
hit, stole second base by a good run, and was followed
by myself, who made another base hit which sent Ray
to third. George Ives knocked a fly ball straight up
in the air, which was caught by Arnold. This was
unfortunate, for neither Ray nor I gained a base thereby.
Then Alfred Burnett struck out—a most exasperating
piece of ill luck.</p>

<p>The fate of the inning now hung upon Dick Palmer,
whose safe hit had been so timely before. I scarcely
dared hope that he would repeat his exploit, but almost
before I had time to think of the matter, bang!
went another base hit and Ray ran in, scoring our
second run, while I reached third base. Then came
Percy Randall, who struck the second ball pitched and
sent it out between center and right fields.</p>

<p>Amidst a great outburst of cheers, he dashed around
the bases, Dick Palmer well ahead of him. I reached
home in safety of course, and was expecting Dick
to follow me, when, to my surprise, I saw him standing
still on third base. His action was explained by
the fact that the right fielder had stopped the ball
sooner than we had anticipated, and had promptly
passed it in to the first baseman, who stood ready
to throw it home if Dick attempted to run.</p>

<p>Percy Randall had not seen this, but supposed the
ball was still in the outfield; so, with his head down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
and not noticing Dick, he kept on running around the
bases. We shouted to him in warning, but, to our
consternation, we saw that he misunderstood us, and it
was not until he reached third base and found Dick
Palmer also there that he realized the situation. He
was badly cut up about the blunder, as were the rest
of us, for it robbed us of an opportunity to win the
lead by securing two more runs. It was too late to
be helped. Dick Palmer was promptly thrown out at
home plate, and we were retired with the score 3–3.
The loss of this opportunity was still more keenly felt
in the last half of the inning, when, after one man
had been put out, we found ourselves with two men
on bases and Arnold at the bat.</p>

<p>I knew only too well that it was fatal to give Arnold
a good ball, so I tried to deceive him by making a
swift motion and delivering a slow ball in front of the
plate, hoping that he would strike over it. I threw it
too far, however, and it proved to be a good ball directly
over the plate. I saw Arnold set his lips, lean
back, and then I knew what was coming. He struck
the ball with a terrific crack and drove it far out over
the center fielder’s head, where it rolled on toward the
gate. My heart sank as I turned and gazed after it,
for I saw there was no hope of recovering it before
Arnold had encircled the bases. He made a home run,
bringing in two men besides himself, and making the
score 6–3 in their favor. It was with long faces
and depressed spirits that we closed that inning.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Ray, as we walked to our bench.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
“It was a bad turn, but we have four innings more
and we can make it up. All the same, we don’t want
to let it happen again.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” I answered; “another hit like that
and we are gone coons.”</p>

<p>The spectators were growing alarmed as to the results
of the game, and were quiet and serious. The
few Park men who had accompanied the nine were,
on the other hand, jubilant and noisy.</p>

<p>“See here, boys,” exclaimed Percy Randall, coming
over from the side of the field where the Park men
were ranged, “we want to lay these fellows out and
no mistake. What do you think they have done?
They’ve just sent a boy to the telegraph office with a
message to Berkeley, ‘Score 6–3. Prepare dinner
for the nine.’ I overheard them give the directions.
How is that for cheek?”</p>

<p>Ray Wendell began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, it is a pity to disappoint them, but we’ll have
to all the same,” he said. “Here, give me my bat
and see me knock that dinner into a cocked hat.”</p>

<p>Ray fulfilled his prophecy by striking a two base hit.
This was a cheerful start, and we succeeded in making
two runs before the inning closed. The spirits of the
spectators rose in proportion, and when we began the
seventh inning with the score 6–5 in their favor the
interest grew rapidly. To the delight of our friends
we closed the Park men out without a run, and made
one ourselves, thus tying the score.</p>

<p>The excitement was now intense, and remained so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
during the eighth inning, in which neither side made
a run. The ninth inning was opened by Percy Randall,
who made a single base hit. The two men that
followed him were put out, but in the mean time,
Percy, by his magnificent base running, had succeeded
in reaching third base. There being two men out,
Percy was on the alert for the least chance to run in
home. In throwing the ball back to Arnold after
the first pitch, the catcher of the Park nine made a
slip, and the ball rolled several yards behind Arnold.
Seizing this small opportunity, Percy suddenly dashed
toward home.</p>

<p>It was an audacious move and altogether unexpected
by Arnold. A cry from the catcher, however, warned
him, and in an instant he had picked up the ball and
hurled it to the home plate. There seemed to be no
chance for Percy, but when he was within twelve feet
of the base he threw himself headlong and slid into
the home plate amidst a cloud of dust. It seemed almost
the same instant that the catcher caught the ball
and touched Percy.</p>

<p>It was a terrible moment of suspense for us. The
crowd had been cheering vociferously, but suddenly
ceased and hung breathlessly upon the umpire’s decision.
For a second there was a dead silence. Then
the umpire’s voice rang out:</p>

<p>“Safe on home.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes it seemed as if we could scarcely
hear our own voices, such an uproar arose from the
spectators. The grand stand fairly rocked with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
swaying, shouting mass of people that filled it. Out
around the grounds the other spectators were dancing
and throwing their hats in the air. For a short period
the movement of the game was interrupted, it being
almost impossible to play in such confusion. Then
the calm, steady voice of the umpire was heard again:</p>

<p>“Play!”</p>

<p>We made no more runs, and the last half of the
ninth inning opened with the score 7–6 in our favor.
The first batter struck a hard line hit about two feet
above the ground and straight at me. I caught it
neatly, but I took no particular credit to myself for
so doing, for the truth of the matter was that I couldn’t
get out of the way of the ball. Then came a long line
hit which sent the batter to second base. The next
man struck out, but he was followed by a batter who
secured his first base and sent the runner to third
base.</p>

<p>This worried me, especially as I saw that Arnold
was again at the bat. There were two men out, and
two men on bases. If Arnold made another long hit—which
he was quite able to do—the game and the
championship would be lost to us. I stood fingering
the ball and looking at Arnold. I had profited by
my former experience, and did not try to deceive him
again by an easy ball.</p>

<p>“I must pitch him a swift ball, and take the chances;
so here goes!” I said to myself, and hurled the ball
in with all my might. Arnold’s bat whizzed through
the air and struck the ball with a disheartening crack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
I had given up hope, and turned about in the full expectation
of finding the ball landed safely out in center
field. Then came the great play of the season. Ray
Wendell ran desperately backward, and, with a frantic
bound, leaped in the air, and <em>caught the ball with one
hand</em>.</p>

<p>The Crimson Banner was ours!</p>

<p>Such a day of triumph Belmont had never known
before. Throughout the rest of the afternoon, and
during the evening, at the promenade concert on the
campus, we were the heroes of the hour, and the recipients
of plaudits and congratulations from every
side.</p>

<p>In those proud and happy hours we reaped a
golden reward for our services to our <i lang="la">alma mater</i>.
Our doubts and disappointments were all forgotten in
that glad season of triumph, when, surrounded by
countless friends, we felt the warm clasp of the many
hands extended to congratulate us, and heard our
names on many lips, coupled with words of warmest
commendation. And now when I think of the long
hours of training we went through, the anxious days
of expectation, and the exciting moments of contest,
I sometimes catch myself wondering whether I would
go through it all again; and then, as I think of those
dear old days and that supremely happy night of
triumph, every vein in my body tingles with the
answer:</p>

<p>“Yes, a thousand times again, if Belmont needed
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The town hall was crowded almost to suffocation the
next day; and by the time the exercises began it
seemed impossible to admit another person. I had
practical reasons for knowing this, for I was one of
the ushers, and was at my wits’ end to dispose of the
masses of people that packed the building.</p>

<p>The hall was gayly decorated with flags and flowers,
and at the upper end, behind the stage, hung a glorious
banner of crimson, with inscriptions upon it in letters
of gold. The banner ordinarily would not have come
to us for some little time after the game; but Tony
Larcom determined that it should grace Ray Wendell’s
valedictory speech, and, partly by strategy, partly by
bluff, succeeded in obtaining it from Berkeley in time
for the exercises. Even cold Dr. Drayton could not
resist a smile as he saw it hanging there; and, in his
words of introduction, he alluded in a dignified but
graceful manner to the victory of the previous day.
From what he said I had a sneaking notion that he
even went to see the game himself—a remarkable
concession on the doctor’s part.</p>

<p>There all the dear boys sat in a row, robed in their
black gowns, and awaiting their turn to speak.
Among the first were Clinton Edwards and Elton,
both of whom delivered fine orations. Then, near the
last, came Len Howard, whose oration had evidently
been prepared with scrupulous care, and whose delivery
was marked for its manly and vigorous tone.
And as he spoke, I saw his eyes wander frequently to
the third row of seats, where sat an old man with snow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
white hair, who was leaning forward intently, his
hand to his ear, that not a syllable should be lost, a
tender smile upon his lips, and his kind eyes dimmed
with tears.</p>

<p>And last of all came the valedictory; and as Ray
Wendell, pale and handsome, stepped quietly forward
and stood before the audience, a roar of applause that
shook the building went up from the crowd, and gently
fluttered the Crimson Banner that hung behind the
speaker and gracefully framed him in.</p>

<p>And when the touching and pathetic words of farewell
had been spoken by Ray, one further tribute remained.
A messenger had come to the door during the
delivery of the valedictory, and had put into my hands
a magnificent basket of flowers. I hurried up the aisle,
and, as Ray closed his oration and bowed, I held the
flowers toward him. He blushed deeply as he leaned
over to take the basket from my hands, and then for
the first time I noticed a tiny card fastened to the
bouquet by a strip of blue ribbon, and bearing the name,
“Miss Nettie Fuller.”</p>
